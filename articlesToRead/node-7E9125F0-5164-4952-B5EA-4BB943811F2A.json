Initially introduced at end-2017, the service enables \u201creal-time parking at both Terminal 1 and 2\u201d once users select the airport as their destination on the T Map. SK Telecom will also use information provided by its base stations near the airport to offer data forecasting the number of people entering the airport. This is expected to enable the airport corporation to arrange necessary manpower in advance before the airport is too crowded.",

    "fullBody": "Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe NSA unfortunately has a long history of violating privacy rules, although this time the agency might not be entirely to blame. The NSA is deleting hundreds of millions of call and text message data records (collected since 2015) after learning of \"technical irregularities\" that led to receiving records it wasn't supposed to obtain under the USA Freedom Act. General counsel Glenn Gerstell told the New York Times in an interview that \"one or more\" unnamed telecoms had responded to data requests for targets by sending logs that included not just the relevant data, but records for people who hadn't been in contact with the targets. As it was \"infeasible\" to comb through all the data and find just the authorized data, the NSA decided to wipe everything.\n\nThe deletions began on May 23rd. It's not certain when the purge ends, but this is all metadata, not the content of the calls and messages themselves. A spokesperson also told the NYT that it didn't include location data, as the Freedom Act doesn't allow gathering that information under this collection system. The companies involved have \"addressed\" the cause of the problem for data going forward, the NSA said.\n\nWhile the step shows that the NSA is willing to err on the side of caution, it continues a streak of privacy violations at the agency since its bulk phone data collection fell under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2004. It also illustrates the problem with keeping such large-scale monitoring in check. The system depends on both the NSA and telecoms strictly honoring the law, and all it takes is a mistake to create a serious privacy breach.\n\nVia: New York Times, Emptywheel\n\nSource: NSA\n\nIn this article: fisa, freedomact, gear, internet, metadata, mobile, nsa, politics, privacy, spying, surveillance, usafreedomact\n\n579 Shares\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nComments\n\nSign In",

    "fullBody": "From fancy showrooms to trendy pop-up stores, direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are increasingly making a splash by moving into physical retail. Yet these store locations are anything but traditional \u2014 they typically provide consumers with interactive and immersive shopping experiences that cannot be found online. This movement into brick and mortar presents a major challenge for retail brands: bridging the online and offline consumer worlds.\n\nI work for a location intelligence company, and we see firsthand how essential it is for brands to bridge the gap between their consumers\u2019 online and offline journeys \u2014 and how challenging it can be. We recently commissioned a study with 451 Research to delve deeper into this subject and identify ways for marketers to effectively map the complete consumer journey. We found that over 70% of marketers strongly agree that understanding offline consumer behavior will help in planning their campaigns, and about half of marketers cite integrating online and offline marketing efforts as a priority.\n\nWhat happens when companies are not just the traditional brick-and-mortar brands, but also DTC brands? Here are three powerful ways e-commerce brands expanding into brick and mortar can drive their offline strategies.\n\nLeverage on-the-ground intelligence.\n\nAs an e-commerce brand, you likely have a trove of insights about your consumers\u2019 online behaviors and interests that you have been leveraging to provide them with the best possible shopping and consumer experience. As you expand in the offline world, you now have an invaluable opportunity to bridge the gap between the two worlds and get on-the-ground intelligence that might lead you to identify new areas of opportunity.\n\nConsider the following questions: How much overlap is there between the consumers coming to your stores and the ones visiting your site? How does the in-store interaction with your brand differ from the experience your consumers are seeing online? How does your store traffic compare to your competitors\u2019, both in terms of volume and consumer segmentation? You might discover that consumer segments you thought were loyal to competitor brands are actually frequent visitors of your stores. You can also hone in on your core personas\u2019 offline interests and behaviors to provide them with a 360-degree experience.\n\nWarby Parker is a perfect example of this. Its stores enhance its seamless and engaging online experience by allowing you to get your glasses fitted or fixed without having to ship them back and wait a few extra days. The company leverages the data and insights at its disposal to create a personal in-store experience. Beyond that, its offline strategy allows it to reach consumers who wouldn\u2019t shop for glasses online \u2014 thus testing the market and expanding its target audience.",

The is the first-year result of a 4-year R&D project, and ITRI plans to develop a complete sensing sub-system, including devices and modules, which can cope with real road conditions at an annual budget of NT$350-400 million (US$11.5-13.2 million) over the next three years.\n\nITRI developed the bus through cooperation with automotive component maker Mobiletron, electric vehicle maker RAC Electric Vehicles, X-by-wire start-up iAuto and National Taiwan University.\n\nITRI has spent over three years developing the autonomous commercial car, including solution to problems concerning obstruction of GPS signals such as using SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) technology. With self-driving decisions fused with real-time sensing, the autonomous commercial car can run in real road and all weather conditions at a speed of 60km/hour, ITRI noted.\n\nThe self-driving software used in the commercial car is modularized, with different modules available for being used in flexible combination depending on needed functionality and road conditions, ITRI said.\n\nITRI\n\nITRI-developed autonomous medium-size bus\nPhoto: ITRI\n\nITRI\n\nITRI-developed autonomous commercial car\nPhoto: ITRI",

The firm has taken steps to hide its connections, but they're hard to avoid. California lists the business as operating at a property owned by Levandowski's father and stepmother, while TC's own sources have attached Levandowski to the company.\n\nIt's not certain when Kache.ai might publicly reveal its plans. The company hasn't responded to requests for comment.\n\nIt's not at all shocking that Levandowski would return to the field he's best known for, though. Between his influential work at Google (where he helped develop Street View and early self-driving tech), Uber and Otto, he has massive amounts of experience in the area.\n\nThe question is whether or not the company will escape the shadow of Levandowski's past. If Kache.ai uses LiDAR to guide self-driving trucks, that could make investors worry that he's 'borrowing' technology from former employers. You don't absolutely need LiDAR for autonomy, though. And if Kache.ai either goes without the sensing tech or otherwise departs from Levandowski's most familiar work, it could serve as a fresh start that suggests the disgraced entrepreneur has cleaned up his act.\n\nSource: TechCrunch, California Secretary of State\n\nIn this article: AnthonyLevandowski, autonomous, gear, google, kache.ai, otto, self-driving, self-drivingcar, transportation, uber\n\n125 Shares\n\nShare\n\nTweet\n\nShare\n\nSave\n\nComments\n\nSign In",

    "fullBody": "The safety of the road users is increased through new solutions and services that are enabled by the 5G technology. The new solutions developed by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland in cooperation with businesses are related to road weather services, road maintenance, automated driving, and real-time inter-vehicle transmission of 3D views.\n\n\u201cThe speed of the 5G network enables transmitting large 3D views between vehicles. As a result, the communication distances of car observations can be increased and data can be obtained from areas which the car\u2019s own sensors do not cover and are not in its view,\u201d says the leader of the 5G-Safe project, aiming for reducing road traffic accidents, Tiia Ojanper\u00c3\u00a4 at VTT.\n\nThe new vehicular network solutions and the local road weather and road safety services enable supporting drivers, road operators and the control systems of automated vehicles. They will require no action from motorists while driving \u00e2\u0080\u0093 data will be gathered and warnings will be sent to users automatically.\n\nThe first piloting target was VTT\u2019s robot car Martti, which was used to test the ability to detect obstacles and ruts in the road. A demo implemented in Sodankyl\u00c3\u00a4 was based on the data transmission of the LiDAR sensor on a 12.5 Hz frequency to the MEC server of VTT\u2019s 5G test network. There, the data was received by Unikie\u2019s algorithm, of which the warnings enabled optimising Martti\u2019s route according to its abilities.\n\n\u201c5G technology can also help improve the quality of weather services. Vehicle-to-vehicle video streaming is an exciting future scenario of the opportunities for broadband transmission of information,\u201d says Senior Research Scientist Timo Sukuvaara at the Finnish Meteorological Institute.\n\n5G technology also opens up new doors for road maintenance services. \u201cReal-time communication and automatic analysis of data allow for faster and more reliable information about the state of the roads. The forecasts produced by the road weather model can be used in services related to driving conditions and safety,\u201d explains Development Manager Oiva Huuskonen at Destia.\n\nThe new solutions piloted under the 5G-Safe project are currently being finalised on the basis of the experiences and results gained so far. Scheduled for completion at the end of 2018, the project is also used to seek for new business opportunities for the companies involved.\n\nIn addition to VTT, the project\u2019s research partners include Destia, the Finnish Meteorological Institute and its commercial services, Kaltiot, SITOWISE, and Unikie. Also, Nokia, Sunit and VR Transpoint participate as in-kind partners. Support is also being provided by a technical advisory group including Bittium, Dynniq (the Netherlands), the Finnish Transport Agency, Telia and the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (Trafi).\n\nShare this:\n\n Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)\n Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)\n\n\nRelated",

Previously in the Vistar marketplace, he said, sellers salespeople would contact potential buyers by phone to communicate the inventory opportunity. Then the buyer would go online to the Vistar marketplace to find the exact signage, set the price and conclude the deal.\n\nNow, he said, the self-service buyer can decide when to look for inventory, find it in Deals Discovery via a demand-side platform, and conclude it online. Here\u2019s a sample Deals screen:\n\nProvenzano said it is typical in the DOOH world to only see online buying opportunities that have been previously discussed offline, such as by phone, and then setting the price and wrapping up the deal online.\n\nThe reason there has been an initial offline encounter before going online, he said, is that a layer of education is still required for many buyers, who often come from the online ad world.\n\nNow, he said, the self-service DOOH buyer can initiate the deal, without first having to go through an offline contact with the seller. Provenzano said the intention is not to replace sellers sales teams but to make inventory more available to self-service buyers.\n\n------------\n\nAbout The Author\n\nBarry Levine\n\nBarry Levine covers marketing technology for Third Door Media.

Justice John Roberts said in the opinion that getting this type of data from a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cell phone provider \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovides an intimate window into a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, revealing not only his particular movements, but through them his familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey now have to have probable cause to believe that person is committing a crime and demonstrate that probable cause to a judge before they go demanding location data,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Ben Ruddell, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois.\n\nThere was little to nothing stopping a law enforcement agency from demanding personal data before this ruling, Ruddell said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll it would have to do is go to the person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cell phone company and demand that information,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nProsecutors argue this ruling will makes catching criminals harder.\n\nTechnology has become so advanced that an agency is able to operate a device that mimics a cell tower. Once a phone connects to the device, thinking it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a point of connection, the controller can extract data from, control, or even contact other devices using the linked phone. All this happens without the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge. Illinois requires a warrant before such devices can be used.",

In 2016, the roads of Gurgaon were flooded leading to severely waterlogged streets, which left thousands of people stranded for several hours. In Mumbai too, such incidents are very common,\" Rishab Gupta, from NSIT, told PTI.\n\n\"The damages caused by such occurrences triggered us to find a practical and feasible solution,\" said Gupta, one of the lead authors of the study that was presented at the Institute of Electricals and Electronics Engineers' (IEEE) 15th International Conference on Smart City in Bangkok last year.\n\nThe study was initially done on Manila, the capital city of Philippines which has similar environmental conditions like cities in India.\n\n\"We first marked the areas in Manila already established to be prone to water logging, based on data obtained from previously conducted surveys,\" Gupta said.\n\nThe areas susceptible to water logging were located with the help of past travel time data (the time taken to travel from one point to the other) sourced from smartphone-based cab service Uber, and elevation data of the area.\n\nThe intensity of water logging was calculated based on the rainfall data and the day of the week, as traffic on weekends is significantly less than that on weekdays.\n\n\"After we ran this data through our trained neural network, we verified the vulnerability of those locations and even came up with more areas defenceless against water logging,\" he said.\n\nThe data was fed into an artificial intelligence system that consists of a neural network that can derive patterns in the information fed to it.\n\nThe system was trained by the students to reveal a water logging intensity score using an algorithm which could determine the extremity of the problem in the area.\n\n\"Our work can be easily modulated for Delhi as the Uber data for Delhi is available now. I can produce the results in 5-10 days,\" said Gupta.\n\n\"This system can be trained to detect patterns on an hourly basis and for the future as well, which is something that even Google can't calculate,\" Gupta said.\n\nPreviously researchers used Internet of Things (IoTs) - a network small electronic devices installed in different locations to gather data about moisture, traffic, etc. However, the high cost of these devices made the project economically unviable.\n\n\"The fact that we could easily access travel time data for free from Uber which is like an open repository of traffic data made things simpler and feasible for us, and gave a practical appeal to the technology,\" Gupta said.\n\nThe system can also be used for pinpointing accident-prone areas and times in a city, for dynamically deciding strategic points for positioning of ambulances, calculating the effect of festivals and holidays on traffic, and can also be employed in urban road planning, he said.",

    "fullBody": "If you want something done right, do it yourself. If only Apple had remembered that six years ago when it launched Maps, which relied heavily on third-party data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFlash forward to today and Google Maps\u2014which arrived in the App Store only after Apple ditched its original Google-powered Maps app\u2014is the sixth most downloaded app of all time on Apple\u2019s own iOS platform. That is, a third-party app from a rival is preferred by many, many iPhone users over the mapping app that comes loaded on their iDevice.\n\nIf that\u2019s humiliating to the Apple executives in charge of Maps\u2014and it should be\u2014they\u2019ve earned it. The first iteration of the new Maps, which shipped with iOS 6 in 2012, was widely criticized for its inaccuracies, omissions, and bugs. Apple CEO Tim Cook even apologized for its inadequacies, which helped prompt the departure of software chief Scott Forstall and later led to the termination of another executive, Richard Williamson. Since then Maps has improved but problems have persisted.\n\nThe black eye could have been avoided had Apple acted more like Apple.\n\nWhen Apple decided to build its own Maps six years ago, it had its share of trepidation about even getting into the mapping business. But the company could see back then that location data would be a key ingredient in much of the functionality it wanted to see in future apps and features. So it went forward.\n\nApple apparently wanted to get a working product together quickly, because it grabbed much of the base map and location data from third-party companies like TomTom and OpenStreetMap. As TechCrunch\u2018s Matthew Panzarino reports, Apple now sees that strategic decision as the root of Maps\u2019 shortcomings. When a new road opened or an error was discovered, it took much too long for Apple to work through the third-party companies to make the necessary corrections.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnd that initial decision to use third-party data runs counter to one of Apple\u2019s most important guiding principles: own everything. The best example is Apple\u2019s decision a decade ago to start designing the chips that run its software.\n\nNow Apple is talking about a major refresh of Maps in which it relies on its own base map and location data, much of it gathered by Apple camera vans. Bloomberg reported in January that Apple had 27 of the vehicles on the road in Northern California.\n\nGoogle, by contrast, owns not just the base mapping images but all the location data and imagery layered on top. Apple told Panzarino it started preparing for the launch of the Maps refresh four years ago.\n\n\u201cApple needs to have some hubris to proudly talk about all of the steps it spent years taking with maps to basically catch up to Google Maps,\u201d quipped Above Avalon\u2019s Neil Cybart in a research note Monday. \u201cApple Maps 2.0 represents the mapping foundation that Apple needed from day one . . . it ended up taking six years to get to a public release.\u201d\n\nApple had some understanding of the importance of mapping software back in 2012, but it can likely see far more now, with the advent of autonomous driving. Panzarino points out that the LiDAR cameras on Apple\u2019a vans gather the kind of data useful not only for Apple Maps but also teaching autonomous vehicles to navigate roadways. The company may be collecting the mapping data needed for the software it\u2019s reportedly building for autonomous cars.\n\nIf Apple is still collecting data in its own Northern California home base, it raises questions about the progress and timing of Project Titan autonomous car initiative. Cybart: \u201cThis sure doesn\u2019t bode well for the presence of self-driving Apple cars on non-U.S. roads anytime soon.\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nRegardless, Apple says its reboot of Maps will start to roll out this fall with an update to iOS 12. Maps will include the company\u2019s new data for just the Bay Area at first, then expand to the rest of the U.S. over the course of the next year.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article implied that Google relied only on its own data to start Maps in 2005. In fact, it relied on NAVTEQ data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement",

That's the contention of technology company Connect&GO, which has designed a cloud-based, single-platform solution to cover three applications at a single site, with a very simple installation and a cost of less than one or two dollars per ticket holder, depending on the number of applications being used.\n\nThe solution, known as Parkpass, is a software platform aimed at three use cases: access control, cashless payments and experiential activations. The system, launched last year (see Connect&Go Offers RFID Wristbands for Amusement and Water Parks) provides park and event attendees with an NFC-enabled wristband that they can use to enter an event, make purchases without cash, and activate games, contests and other experiences that they might also share on social media.\n\nThe Parkpass wristband\n\nThe system is designed to coordinate a variety of contactless features, which can include opening lockers, such as at a water park, as well as access to an online photo album and safety features for children. For park managers, it's about analytics and the data they can employ to better understand traffic movement, what interests attendees and how they can increase sales onsite.\n\nConnect&GO, a spinoff company from RFID Academia, has offered software, as well as NFC-enabled wristbands and readers, for about five years (see Osheaga Music Festival to Include New NFC-enabled Features). The firm serves amusement parks, sporting events, concerts, festivals and family entertainment centers. Its NFC solution has been used for some or all three functions\u00e2\u0080access control, payments and electronic experiences\u00e2\u0080at sites including Canada House at this year's Winter Olympics village.\n\nIn November 2017, Connect&GO first released its Parkpass system, centered around providing a single, easy point of entry at a cost of about 50 cents per wristband and per function, says Anthony Palermo, the company's CEO. \"The system is designed to be simple and easy to deploy,\" he states. With Parkpass, users can simply fill out a questionnaire about their facility and the types of services they want to provide. Connect&GO will then configure the solution and provide the NFC readers (using off-the-shelf technology) to be utilized by park employees. The readers can be set up at gates, points of sale or kiosks, while staff members can carry handheld readers to scan wristbands as well.",

A range of technologies including TRACTUS by Matrix IT Medical Tracking Systems Inc. will be evaluated as part of the effort, which goes hand-in-hand with the Unique Identification Initiative (UDI) to reduce medical device related injuries and deaths.\n\n \n\nMedical device implant documentation is an incredibly manual process, often times requiring a nurse to spend valuable time writing down identification numbers and then entering them into the patients medical record at a later date, Dr. Brandon Donnelly, CTO of Matrix IT Medical Tracking Systems Inc., told HCB News. Further, product stickers or packaging might have multiple barcodes, leading to confusion on which one to scan, including when paper barcodes have faded or been easily damaged.\n\nThe idea of converting manual recording methods to automated barcode scanning is becoming widely popular for the prevention of human error as hospitals continue to digitize medical health records.\n\nDirect part mark scanning is one of these automated approaches that cuts average documentation time for a nurse from six minutes to ten seconds while using live decoding to alert clinicians if a product or implant is expired or subject to recall. Government mandation of direct part marking also requires large manufacturers to make more information easily accessible.\n\nEquipped for UDI with a machine learning, advanced data analytics platform powered by Google, TRACTUS captures sterile, direct part marked implants and instruments, 1D and 2D barcodes on packaging and RFID, decoding in real-time and alerting nurses to recalls or out-of-date items.\n\nIt also ensures automatic transfers of data to the EMR, billing and decrements from the hospitals inventory system and will be assessed against various solutions including, Medtronics clip-on 2-D scanner tag system which risks getting lost and has even had cases of clips being implanted in patients and human readable, laser marked characters on implants that are difficult to read due to their small font size, require human-enabled decoding and lack the 50+ characters of a UDI.\n\nPages: 1 - 2 >>",

Baidu will also use Mobileye\u2019s camera-based surround computer vision system for automated vehicles being developed for the Chinese market.\n\n\u201cOur team recognizes the value and critical role that Mobileye\u2019s RSS model plays in safely deploying autonomous driving,\u201d Weihao Gu, general manager of Baidu\u2019s Intelligent Driving Unit, said in a statement.\n\nAdditionally, Baidu said at is Create developer conference in Beijing on Wednesday that it\u2019s begun \u201cvolume\u201d production of Apolong autonomous mini-buses with so-called Level 4 autonomous capability. Developed with Chinese busmaker King Long, the vehicles hold up to 14 passengers will soon enter commercial operation in cities including Beijing, Shenzhen, Pingtan and Wuhan, Baidu said.\n\n\u201c2018 marks the first year of commercialization for autonomous driving,\u201d Baidu Chairman and CEO Robin Li said in livestreamed comments to mark the production of the 100th Apolong vehicle. \u201cFrom the volume production of Apolong, we can truly see that autonomous driving is making great strides.\u201d\n\nTypically known as the Google of China, Baidu has evolved into a major player in autonomous vehicle technology with an alternative approach to that of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Waymo and General Motors\u2019 Cruise. Rather than developing all the technology needed in-house and on its own, Baidu has promoted an open-source approach to self-driving software and AI with Apollo since April 2017. The effort counts hundreds of companies as partners, more than a 100 of which are auto and tech firms including Ford, lidar maker Velodyne, Bosch, Nvidia, Daimler, Valeo, Jaguar Land Rover, Byton and many of China\u2019s largest domestic auto and truck makers.\n\nBaidu has said it wants Apollo to become the Android operating system of autonomous vehicles, and that it\u2019s taking the lead to ensure the quality of the tech platform. It unveiled Apollo 3.0 on Wednesday in Beijing, with software upgrades for valet parking, and for autonomous mini-buses and micro-cars.\n\nChina has placed a priority on being a leader in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. After the rollout of Baidu\u2019s Apolong shuttles, which operate without a human driver in geo-fenced areas, a slew of Chinese carmakers participating in Apollo have plans to follow starting in 2019 with a range of robotic cars, vans and commercial vehicles.",

A new vector-based SVF calculation tool was implemented in a free and open source Geographic Information System named OrbisGIS. Its accuracy and computational performance are compared to the ones of an existing raster based algorithm used in SAGA-GIS. The study is performed on 72 urban blocks selected within the Paris commune territory. This sample has been chosen to represent the heterogeneity of nine of the ten Local Climate Zone built types. The effect of the algorithms\u2019 input parameters (ray length, number of directions and grid resolution) is investigated. The combination minimizing the computation time and the SVF error is identified for SAGA-GIS and OrbisGIS algorithms. In both cases, the standard deviation of the block mean SVF estimate is about 0.03. A simple linear relationship having a high determination coefficient is also established between block mean SVF and the facade density fraction, confirming the results of previous research. This formula and the optimized combinations for the OrbisGIS and the SAGA-GIS algorithms are finally used to calculate the SVF of every urban block of the Paris commune. View Full-Text",

    "fullBody": "Published: June 26, 2018\n\nNaming rights at sports stadiums have traditionally been a coveted\u2014albeit, expensive\u2014investment for major brands. With baseball season in full swing, and marketers beginning to demand more from their sponsorships of sports teams, Gravy Analytics leveraged foot traffic to examine whether the sponsorship investments made by brands at popular baseball stadiums around the U.S. are worth it.\n\nUsing location data, Gravy analyzed visits to baseball stadiums in the U.S. during April of this year, looking to see how baseball fans compare and whether the brands that sponsor each stadium are capturing the attention of the right customers. For ease of comparison, Gravy indexed all stadiums against Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, New York.\n\n\u201cMLB sponsorship spending topped $892 million last season,\u201d says Gravy Analytics CEO and Founder Jeff White. \u201cIt made me wonder if these brands\u2019 investments are really moving the needle in awareness, influence, and future sales.\u201d\n\nLooking at stadium sponsorships at top baseball stadiums across the country, White and his team found that companies from just a handful of industries\u2014alcohol brands, automotive brands, and financial services firms\u2014represent an outsized portion of major stadium sponsors.\n\nCitibank and PNC Bank both sponsor fields in their home cities of New York and Pittsburgh, and based on Gravy\u2019s findings, both banks know their customers well. Gravy found that visitors to PNC Park in Pittsburgh are significantly more likely to visit PNC Bank than visitors at every other stadium. Similarly, visitors to Citi Field, home of the New York Mets, are more likely to have recently visited a Citibank location.\n\nAnother smart investment, based on Gravy\u2019s analysis, was the Boston-based brewer Samuel Adams\u2019 move to become the official beer of the Red Sox in late 2017. Gravy found that baseball fans at Coors Field, Wrigley Field, and Fenway Park are the biggest beer lovers. Fans at those same three stadiums also over-indexed for visits to bars and happy hour events, suggesting that they enjoy the occasional drink (or two). Ketel One chose to sponsor Dodger Stadium, and Jim Beam sponsors several different stadiums, including Yankee Stadium, Citi Field, and PNC Park.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great opportunity for brands and marketers to assess how well their sponsorship dollars are performing\u2014and what they can be doing differently to maximize their reach and future ROI,\u201d White says.\n\nVisitors at Dodger Stadium and Fenway Park were more likely to be in the market for a new car than visitors at any other stadium on Gravy\u2019s list, making Lexus\u2019 decision to sponsor Dodger Stadium a savvy one.\n\nComparing two automotive brands head-to-head, Gravy found that visitors at the Lexus-sponsored Dodger Stadium are also more likely to have recently visited a Lexus dealership than visitors at the Hyundai-sponsored Citi Field.\n\n\u201cBy helping brands and marketers to understand who is in the audience, they can make more informed decisions about their stadium sponsorships and better meet their marketing objectives,\u201d White says.\n\nFor example, an automaker like Hyundai might choose to sponsor a stadium in an area where the company dominates sales, in order to really solidify its presence in the market.\n\n\u201cConversely, a brand looking to grow their market share might want to put more sponsorship dollars toward stadiums where the audience isn\u2019t as familiar with their cars to build brand awareness,\u201d White says.\n\nMore broadly speaking, White hopes brands can look at Gravy\u2019s analysis and see that they have opportunities to use location data and other forms of consumer intelligence to inform their marketing decisions. And while there is no guarantee on a good return on investment with sports team sponsorships, location data can be a good starting point.\n\n\u201cTheir spend doesn\u2019t have to be a guessing game\u2014it can be done with greater smarts and confidence,\u201d White says. \u201cLocation intelligence is an extremely valuable tool that helps brands make more informed decisions about where, when, and how much to invest in sponsorships.\u201d\n\nStephanie Miles is a senior editor at Street Fight.",

These included professionals from businesses such as travel and logistics, retail, ecommerce and warehousing.\n\nThe study found 93% of respondents saying that product-return remains a key challenge for the industry as reverse logistics are not at-par with delivery services.\n\nAround 58% of return processes have a return-charge levied on them that the customer needs to pay. This comes as a challenge for the rapidly growing e-commerce businesses and logistical companies as the business has been booming but the lack of proper product-return processes remains a dark spot, the study found out.\n\nRetailers and logistic providers believe that the biggest challenge is the distance of the warehouse from where the product is sourced. Availability of warehouses near major centres will help accommodate return processes faster and even free-of-cost.\n\nAdditionally, the study found that digitisation is yet to be widespread in the business and a large number of people use pen and paper. This leads to inefficiency in records.",

This, the company explains, affirms that it adheres to the internationally standard for quality management.\n\n\"Metalcraft has had a strong history of committing to our quality system and continuous improvement,\" said Jim Miller, Metalcraft's VP of engineering and quality, in a prepared statement. \"When the new standard came out, we saw that as a better fit for us and a great opportunity to take our system to the next level\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Our certification means we are taking a hard look at ourselves and working as a team to make improvements in all aspects of the business, so our customers can rely on a quality product every time.\"\n\nUtility Composites Intros RFID Tag for Rough Wooden Surfaces\n\nUtility Composites, which manufactures and markets non-metal fasteners used in several markets, including timber and lumber, has unveiled its SUNDOG RFID tag. The timber industry has been poised to adopt UHF RFID technology for inventory management, but the use of standard RFID tags attached to logs traveling down the highway under extreme weather conditions was not feasible, the company reports. RFID tags tended to be expensive and time-consuming to screw into wood, according to the company, or the tags were too fragile to withstand the demanding conditions of the industry.\n\nThe SUNDOG RFID tag is in the form of a staple that is collated into a strip of staple tags, each containing a UHF RFID chip and antenna. They are collated in a strip for loading into a magazine of a manual or pneumatic stapler. The tags are rugged enough to withstand extreme variations in climate, the company reports, as well as kiln drying and vat cooking operations typical in timber and veneer processing, with no negative effect on the readability of the tag. Readability and range are maintained upon completion of these harsh processes.\n\nAccording to the company, the tags have a strong read range and read angle. The antenna sticks out away from the surface, reducing reading problems, with high moisture content of freshly harvested logs. For handheld readings in the x, y and z direction, the range varies from 8 to 11.3 meters using a circular polarized interrogator antenna, and from 6 to 8.3 meters using a linear polarized interrogator antenna.\n\nCurrently, Utility Composites is sending sample quantities of tags for testing in applications for log tracking, lumber load tracking, utility pole tracking and railroad tie tracking for inventory management. The firm expects the tags to be in full production during the quarter of this year.",

These tariffs will do nothing to protect U.S. jobs, but they will undermine the benefits of tax reform and drive up prices for a wide range of products as diverse as tool sets, batteries, remote controls, flash drives and thermostats. And students could pay more for the mini-refrigerator they need in their dorm room as they head back to college this fall.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge the administration to abandon its plans for tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese imports, which would destroy thousands of American jobs and raise prices on virtually everything sold in our stores. Reining in China\u2019s abusive trade policies is a goal shared by many countries, but a strategy based on unilateral tariffs is the wrong approach and it has to stop.\u201d\n\nAbout NRF\n\nThe National Retail Federation is the world\u2019s largest retail trade association.

    "fullBody": "The door is wide open for President Trump to influence the Supreme Court's approach to privacy in the digital age as he chooses a replacement for retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nKennedy, the court's famed swing vote, leaves behind a varied legacy on privacy matters, siding with law enforcement in cases involving digital surveillance while also joining majorities in decisions that expanded privacy protections against unreasonable searches. And while Trump is all but certain to tap a conservative, that's no predictor for how the new justice will rule in the bevy of cases expected to come before the court concerning how the Fourth Amendment applies in an era of ever expanding data collection.\n\n\"This is ironically one of those areas that doesn't necessarily fall on ideological lines,\" said Jennifer Daskal, a professor at American University Washington College of Law. \"This is not a place where it's obvious what the likely leanings of the next justice are going to be.\"\n\nKennedy's own leanings on privacy are hard to put in a box. While the court overall in recent years has recognized broader digital privacy rights as technologies have advanced, Kennedy has showed ambivalence about how far those protections should stretch.\n\nIn the 2012 case United States v. Jones, he sided with the court's other justices in finding that law enforcement officers typically need a warrant to track people using GPS devices. And he joined another unanimous opinion in Riley v. California in 2014 declaring warrantless cellphone searches unconstitutional in most cases. Both decisions were hailed by privacyadvocates and represented significant expansions of Fourth Amendment protections.\n\n\"Kennedy was mixed in terms of how much he understood, and he grappled with the ways in which the Internet and digital communications change the application of existing doctrine,\" Daskal told me.\n\nWhoever takes Kennedy's place probably will have the opportunity to decide a range of new privacy-related cases, privacy experts said. For example, the high court has yet to rule on whether police need a warrant to access location data from cell towers over short periods of time or comb through records generated by Internet of things devices such as smartwatches. The court is also poised to hear cases involving searches of digital devices at the U.S. border, surveillance from drones and security cameras, and collection of biometric data, experts said.\n\n\"There's definitely space for whoever replaces Kennedy to come in with potentially more knowledge and respect for the impact that technology is having on privacy,\" said Amie Stepanovich, U.S. policy manager at the digital rights group Access Now. \"There's going to be a lot of room to do good by the court in the privacy space because we're only going to see more cases heading in that direction as we see tech tools advance.\"\n\nBut even if Trump taps someone opposed to expanding privacy rights, it may not be enough in the near term to dramatically alter the court's general trajectory on digital privacy. On those issues, Kennedy had less power to shift the court than he did on other issues such as abortion rights or same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Privacy and surveillance issues were not one of the areas where Justice Kennedy was one of the so-called swing votes,\" said Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project who represented the plaintiffs in the Carpenter case. \"I'm not sure that we'll see an immediate change in the direction of the court's jurisprudence wherever [Trump's nominee] falls on the spectrum.\"",

Vance Spath \u201chas an approved retirement date of Nov. 1, 2018,\u201d Air Force spokeswoman Brooke Brzozowske said in a one-sentence email response to a question from McClatchy. She did not say when the colonel submitted his paperwork for retirement.\n\nSpath has been chief of the U.S. Air Force judiciary since April 2014. He been serving as the judge in the USS Cole case at Guantanamo since the summer of 2014. He did not respond Thursday to efforts by McClatchy to reach him via his social media accounts.\n\nSpath drew national attention for his November conviction of Marine Brig. Gen. John Baker after summary contempt proceedings, making Baker the first U.S. citizen to be convicted of a crime at the war court created by President George W. Bush to try suspected foreign war criminals in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nAt issue was a decision by Baker, the chief defense counsel for military commissions, to release three defense attorneys from the USS Cole case. The attorneys said they had an ethical obligation to quit after Spath forbade them to investigate their discovery of a listening device hidden in the confidential attorney-client meeting room at the U.S. Navy base in Cuba. Spath said only he, as the case judge, had the power to release defense attorneys of record. He several times ordered Pentagon paid defense attorneys Rick Kammen, Rosa Eliades and Mary Spears to return to the capital case; they refused.\n\nGuantanamo inmate Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, held by the CIA from 2002 to 2006, is accused of plotting al-Qaida\u2019s suicide bombing of the warship that killed 17 U.S. sailors off Aden, Yemen, on Oct. 12, 2000. He could face military execution, if he is convicted.\n\nIn February, Spath declared his frustration over uncertainty of the mechanics of military commissions and halted all pretrial proceedings in the case, pending clarification of his authority from higher courts. \u201cI am abating these proceedings indefinitely,\u201d he declared Feb. 16 before walking off the war court bench at Guantanamo. \u201cWe\u2019re done until a superior court tells me to keep going.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Spath mentioned that he was weighing retirement.\n\nLast month, a federal judge ruled that Spath \u201cacted unlawfully when he unilaterally convicted\u201d Baker \u201cof criminal contempt and sentenced him for that contempt\u201d at the Guantanamo war court on Nov. 1, 2017. Spath sentenced the general to 21 days confinement and to pay a $1,000 fine. Because the brig at the Guantanamo Navy base was not operating at the time, the Air Force judge instead confined him to his quarters \u2014 a trailer park behind the war court compound, called Camp Justice.\n\nThe Pentagon overseer released the general from his confinement after two nights in the trailer as a federal court was weighing whether the Air Force judge had deprived the Marine general of due process.\n\nAs of Thursday there was no notice of Spath\u2019s pending retirement on the USS Cole case docket at a Pentagon website for military commissions.\n\nAl-Nashiri\u2019s prosecutors have asked a Pentagon panel, the U.S. Court of Military Commission Review, to clarify a range of questions Spath raised, including the scope of war court contempt authority as well as who has the power to release attorneys of record from ongoing proceedings.\n\nMore from this section\n\n2:37\n\nStep Inside a Secret Garden Oasis in Vegas\n\nSupreme Court: Cops need warrant for cell phone location data\n\nData Breaches Continue \u2013 Protect Yourself\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a92018 Miami Herald\n\nVisit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPHOTO (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194): Col.

    "fullBody": "What needs to happen before we see autonomous vehicles in regular use? originally appeared on Quora: the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world.\n\nAnswer by Mike Volpi, Partner at Index Ventures, on Quora:\n\nI believe we\u2019re still a long way away from autonomous vehicles becoming ubiquitous. We need a lot more mileage (literally!) under our belts, and more experience with so-called edge cases. What I mean by that is experience with unexpected situations such as: a passenger jumping unexpectedly in front of a self-driving car, a hidden stop sign after a tight turn, or a scooter or biker weaving in and out of the bike lane.\n\nI\u2019d also include here exposure to adverse weather or to roadways with small tolerances. The more scenarios the autonomous vehicle and its software is exposed to, the safer and more reliable autonomous driving will become.\n\nThe second thing that will need to happen is cost reductions and scale production of the perception equipment. Some of the key sensors, including LIDAR and RADAR, are still very expensive, as is the computing infrastructure on every vehicle, so for AVs to scale up there the prices will have to come down significantly.\n\nThirdly, there needs to be a lot more collaboration between the implicated industry players. Government agencies will need to work together to create a consistent regulatory framework that addresses the concerns over passenger and pedestrian safety. Auto OEMs and their tier one suppliers need closer collaboration with AV technology companies so that they can design vehicles with self-driving technology built in from the start rather than retrofitted. And ride-hailing companies and AV technology providers should be working much more closely too, as there\u2019s obviously huge potential there.\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the place to gain and share knowledge, empowering people to learn from others and better understand the world. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. More questions:\n\n* Venture Capital: How is venture capital changing in 2018, and what can we expect over the next 5 years?\n\n* Innovation: Will AI will be able to suggest ideas of startup innovations?\n\n* Technology: Would a self-driving vehicle race be won by a car company or a technological company?",

Very few companies can identify where consumers are, where they have been, or where they are going without some guesswork. Even when customer whereabouts are known, context about the environment around them tends to be missing or inaccurate.\n\nBeyond simple maps, the advertising industry generally lacks accurate data about the static environment to cross reference with dynamic location data from consumers' mobile devices. This makes it difficult to answer questions such as: Where do they go? What time are they home? How long does it take them to commute to work? What do they like doing on Saturday mornings? What media do they come across in the day\u00e2\u0080\u0093on their mobile, laptop, car radio, billboards, beacons in stores, on TV. How are ads they saw three days ago on their laptops influencing what they're doing now?\n\nBudget allocated to geo-targeted ads is expected to rise from $12.4 billion in 2016 to $32.4 billion in 2021, according to BIA Kelsey.\n\nTransforming advertising\n\nLocation is the only source of data that spans every activity and media experience of a consumer throughout the day from what they see on the way to work, to what they watch on TV at night. And this is why advanced location-enabled intelligence is transforming advertising. It acts as a bridge between the digital and physical worlds\u00e2\u0080\u0093helping you make sense of, and leverage, all the data you hold about consumers.\n\nA greater understanding of where consumers have been, where they are, and where they're going leads to a clearer picture of who the consumer is\u00e2\u0080\u0093revealing patterns and enabling predictions. For example, if a consumer commutes into the center of a city from a wealthy suburb every day, they can be assumed to be an affluent individual. The shops and restaurants they visit might support this assumption. Similarly, if someone visits a university campus each day and returns to a student hall at night, they might be assumed to be a student.\n\nLocation intelligence combined with data sources, such as social media or mobile apps, can surface what people visiting certain places are feeling and thinking. Machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques can help analyze and process all this unstructured data, to then build patterns and predictions.\n\nFor more insights from HERE Technologies on how location data is going to inform the advertising ecosystem, download the full white paper here.\n\nMedia Gallery",

    "fullBody": "Right now, a lot of people are very excited about the future of technologies like AR, VR, AI, and autonomous vehicles. However, as I\u2019ve written before, most of these technologies are relatively useless without contextual awareness. I have also written in the past about the importance of image sensors and how they enable AI and autonomous systems to better understand the world around them. Combining location awareness and vision is incredibly difficult and is fundamentally what enables app developers to anchor digital assets in the real world for augmented reality. There are currently only two companies capable of doing this\u2014\n\nGoogle\nGOOGL +1.15%\n\nGoogle\n\nGOOGL\n\n$1154.43$13.1(+1.15%)\n\nAs of 07/06/2018, 02:32pm EDT\n\nand Mapbox. Today I wanted to talk about the lesser known of the two.\n\nMapbox announces new SDKs and partnerships\n\nMapbox has a leg up on Google in that it provides more flexible options for linking image sensors and contextual awareness. Just in the last month, Mapbox announced numerous partnerships and initiatives to further improve location awareness. First, Mapbox announced a partnership with the world leader in mobile chip design, Arm, to implement its new Vision SDK. Mapbox claims the Vision SDK will provide a fusion of visual and location data to improve the accuracy and overall experience of AR. The Vision SDK is arguably one of the biggest announcements out of Mapbox in quite some time\u2014it expands the company\u2019s capabilities while also giving its developers more tools to work with when it comes to live location. It will help developers enable more robust AR in places like automotive navigation. The more developers utilize Mapbox\u2019s platform in their applications, the more Mapbox will thrive.\n\nMapbox also announced the React Native AR SDK and SceneKit SDK for iOS\u2014two developer kits geared towards building AR experiences for mobile. These announcements have the potential to be game-changers. Most AR applications today behave very similarly to VR applications, confined to a single room or a single surface (like a table). Because of this, many consumers and businesses don\u2019t find AR much more compelling than VR\u2014both confine you to a certain space. The real world is where AR really shines, but only if applications can utilize live location correctly and with a reasonable amount of accuracy. I believe Mapbox\u2019s live AR mapping capabilities will enable the next phase of world-scale AR apps, bringing AR much closer to realizing its full potential. Mapbox is investing heavily to enable AR virtually anywhere, which is why you see them continuing to add SDK support and features that make world-scale AR easier to implement.\n\nWhile Google and Mapbox both offer similar capabilities, its worth noting that some of the biggest applications in the world run on Mapbox\u2019s mapping platform. These companies include Foursquare, Snapchat, Tinder,\n\nUber\n, and many more who rely on map accuracy and live location. Mapbox\u2019s trustworthy status as an independent, 3rd party likely appeals to many of these companies. As more users become aware of how their data is used by companies like Google, they will likely become more concerned about how their location data is gathered, and by whom.\n\nWrapping up\n\nUltimately, I believe these new SDKs from Mapbox will help usher in the next generation of AR, AI, and Autonomous Vehicle applications. The company\u2019s flexibility and independent status make the company an attractive option for developers wary of Google, and I think we\u2019re going to see its platform integrated into more and more applications in the coming years. We\u2019re only at the very beginning of what\u2019s possible with this technology, and I look forward to seeing what\u2019s next.\n\nDisclosure: Moor Insights & Strategy, like all research and analyst firms, provides or has provided research, analysis, advising and/or consulting to many high-tech companies in the industry, including\n\nGoogle\nGOOGL +1.15%\n\nGoogle\n\nGOOGL\n\n$1154.43$13.1(+1.15%)\n\nAs of 07/06/2018, 02:32pm EDT\n\n, Mapbox, and many others.

Photo: Warner Bros.\n\nBetween big blockbusters like Thor Ragnarok and Star Wars: The Last Jedi or critical darlings like Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, there are seemingly too many great movies to catch right now. That is a problem is largely because movie tickets can get pretty expensive, especially in places like New York City.\n\nSince its founding in 2011, MoviePass has given its customers a way to circumvent the prohibitively expensive cost of movie theaters with a monthly subscription model. Before today, you paid $10 per month and got unlimited access to single tickets at major movie theaters around the United States. According to Engadget, if you act quickly, you can get in on the action for a significant discount.\n\nMoviePass announced a new, limited time annual plan at a price of $89.95, or just below $7 per month, for a years worth of movie tickets. The limit is two of these annual plans per household and, according to the MoviePass website, the offer is valid until its not. If you can scrounge up $90 right now without going bankrupt, you can get into the next calendar year of movies for free.\n\nKeep in mind you have to pay all of it up front. The normal monthly plan is still $10 per month. Depending on where you live, you might break even or save money after seeing one movie on the regular plan. If you pony up the $90 for the new plan, you might as well be stealing movie tickets.\n\nThis comes after MoviePass dropped its price to $10 per month back in August. Prior to that, the cost scaled from $15 to $21 depending on location. As Engadget points out, the extreme surge in signups after the price drop led to card shipments being delayed to new customers. For reference, the MoviePass card is how you get free tickets at the theater.\n\nAfter you have received your card, you can open the MoviePass app on iPhone or Android and search supported theaters and showtimes in your area. Theoretically, you then go to the theater and get your ticket without a fuss. Even though theaters are compensated by MoviePass for these free tickets, they are not always huge fans of the startups business practices. AMC, in particular, wanted to sever ties with MoviePass as recently as August.\n\nCaveats include the fact that one MoviePass card gets you one free ticket, so everyone in a household needs their own card. You also need to pick up the ticket at the theater on the day of the show, so if you wanted to use MoviePass to reserve advance tickets for Star Wars: The Last Jedi, you will unfortunately need to pay like the rest of us. Of course, you can pick up tickets several hours before a show if you want to make sure it does not get sold out.\n\nThe lack of a firm end date for the new MoviePass discount is probably a deliberate way to create a sense of urgency around it. If it is tempting and you can afford it, the service is popular enough that it seems to be worth it.\n\nMoviePass Theater Locations\n\nTo find out which theaters near you accept MoviePass, visit MoviePass' website. Once there either click \"allow\" is the site asks you for location data or scroll to the bottom of the page and enter your ZIP code on the top left portion of the map. Once you've done that all participating MoviePass theaters near you should pop up.",

    "fullBody": "Theatrical subscriptions service MoviePass has revealed that it will soon use location data of its users to make money. The move isnt viewed as something surprising, considering that the app grants users the ability to watch movies in theaters every day for just $9.95 per month.\n\nMoviePass CEO Mitch Lowe disclosed at a recent Hollywood event that the service will soon collect user location data and monetize such information. We get an enormous amount of information. We watch how you drive from home to the movies. We watch where you go afterwards, Lowe said at the event.\n\nTechCrunch points out that Lowes statement proves that MoviePass is not camouflaging the fact that the company is not treating users as clients but as products. After all, the location data that MoviePass will be making money from will be encoded to the service by users themselves every time they go to the cinema to watch a film.\n\nThe tracking system of MoviePass is also exposed to actually do more than obtaining data about a users trip to a nearby theater. It tracks users even before they leave their homes and after enjoying a big screen experience. For instance, they could go for drinks afterwards and their location will be stored to the app as well.\n\nAccording to MacRumors, MoviePass has made no secret of its plan to monetize its users location data. The service is owned by a data analytics form who has been very vocal about its plan to generate income out of user data.\n\n\"There are dozens and dozens of businesses like ours that invest in building a large subscriber base. Netflix buys $8 billion of content a year, and believe me, they have to borrow the money to do it. Or companies like Facebook -- it's free, but they're monetizing all the advertising and all the data about you. That's exactly what we are [doing], Lowe told Recode last month.\n\nThe problem with what MoviePass is planning to do however lies on the extent of data its app is collecting. It is being assumed that the service will soon collect data like ticket sales, movie choice, promotions and many other things, and such act of hoarding information could invade user privacy.\n\nFortunately, iOS users could combat this invasion of privacy by restricting access of the MoviePass app to their location on their device. They can head to Settings > Privacy > Location Services and select MoviePass. They can the choose from Never, While Using the App or Always for their preferred restriction.",

    "fullBody": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 They're all younger than 55 and conservative enough to make a first cut. But the four judges who are apparently the finalists for President Donald Trump's second Supreme Court nomination are being measured against a set of questions that go well beyond age and ideology.\n\nPresidents weigh all sorts of considerations in deciding on a Supreme Court nominee, often beginning with the big question: Will the choice be confirmed by the Senate? Academic credentials, professional experience and sometimes even gender, race and geographical diversity all can be part of the equation.\n\nThe stakes are sky high for filling the opening created by Justice Anthony Kennedy's imminent retirement. The new justice has the potential to entrench conservative control of the Supreme Court for years to come.\n\nHere are some of the pluses and minuses for each of the presumed leading candidates, in alphabetical order:\n\n___\n\nAMY CONEY BARRETT, 46, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit\n\nIf Trump is looking to make history, Barrett could have some appeal. If she's chosen and confirmed, it would be the first time four women would serve together on the nine-member Supreme Court. In addition, she is the youngest of the leading candidates, and Trump has said he wants his nominee to serve for decades. Barrett, a longtime law professor at the University of Notre Dame, also served as a law clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who is beloved by conservatives. And she recently made it through the confirmation process, with the Senate approving her nomination to be an appeals court judge in October. Three Democrats voted for her then.\n\nBut Barrett's recent ascension to the appeals court means she does not have the long, conservative record that lawmakers on the right find reassuring. Barrett is also seen as a potentially divisive nominee because of statements she's made about her Catholic faith and about abortion. In her 20s she co-authored a paper that said Catholic judges, if they are faithful to church teachings, are \"morally precluded\" from enforcing the death penalty. At her recent confirmation hearing, however, she said it was never permissible for judges to \"follow their personal convictions in deciding a case.\" More recently, she's written that abiding by precedent is \"not a hard-and-fast rule\" in the Supreme Court's constitutional cases. Although the statement is undoubtedly accurate, it is likely to be seized on by supporters of abortion rights as they try to convince moderate Republican senators that Barrett might vote to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision declaring a woman's constitutional right to abortion.\n\n___\n\nTHOMAS HARDIMAN, 52, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n\nHardiman was a runner-up when Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the high court in 2017. He might appeal to Trump if the president is looking for someone from a blue-collar background. Hardiman was the first in his family to attend college, at the University of Notre Dame, then helped pay for his law school education at Georgetown by driving a taxi. Hardiman has some notable opinions in his 11 years on the appeals court that could appeal to Trump, including upholding strip searches of jail inmates, even those arrested on minor charges, backing collection of genetic evidence from people at the time of their arrest, and dissenting from a ruling that upheld gun regulations in New Jersey.\n\nHardiman's judicial chambers are in Pittsburgh, where his wife comes from a family of prominent Democrats. He also was a colleague of Trump's sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who stopped hearing cases last year. Some conservative groups don't trust Barry because she wrote an opinion striking down a New Jersey abortion regulation in 2000, and they hope she has no influence over her brother's choice.\n\n___\n\nBRETT KAVANAUGH, 53, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nRoughly 300 opinions in 12 years as a judge and a raft of legal articles and speaking engagements make Kavanaugh the most prolific of the prospective nominees. He is widely viewed as a skilled, conservative judge on what is often called the second most powerful court in America. His opinions include several dissents that were later vindicated by Supreme Court majority opinions. Kavanaugh, who worked on the investigation that led to President Bill Clinton's impeachment, later wrote that he thinks presidents shouldn't have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a view that Trump might find attractive. He attended Yale both as an undergraduate and law student, and served as a law clerk to Kennedy. He is active in his local Catholic church and as a coach for his daughters' basketball teams.\n\nSome social conservatives fear Kavanaugh isn't committed to issues that matter to them, like abortion. They cite a recent case involving a pregnant teenaged immigrant in federal custody. Kavanaugh would have delayed the teen's abortion, in line with the Trump administration's position, but another judge would have gone farther and declared that, as someone who is in the U.S. illegally, the teen had no right at all to an abortion. Kavanaugh's close ties to the Bush family, stemming from his five years in the White House under President George W. Bush, might not be a positive to Trump, who has sparred with the Bushes. Kavanaugh also was a clerk for Judge Alex Kozinski, who retired abruptly last year as allegations of sexual misconduct grew.\n\n___\n\nRAYMOND KETHLEDGE, 51, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nKethledge's 10 years as a federal appeals court judge give him a long record of conservative opinions that may make Trump and Republican senators feel secure about the kind of Supreme Court justice he'd be. He's written opinions siding against unions in a dues collection case, admonishing the IRS in a case about its targeting of conservative groups and okaying broad access by the government to cellphone location data, an opinion overturned last month by the Supreme Court. He's also seen as a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.\n\nLike Kavanaugh, Kethledge is a former Kennedy clerk and would no doubt cite that experience in attempting to appeal to moderates. Kethledge also has first-hand experience with Congress. For about a year and a half in the 1990s, Kethledge was counsel to Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham of Michigan. If Kethledge is the nominee, that experience working for Congress could help in the customary courtesy visits to senators before a confirmation hearing.\n\nAt the same time, Kethledge left Washington to return to Michigan two decades ago. He probably has fewer friends in the nation's capital than Kavanaugh, but Trump may put value on the fact he's an outsider and less well known in Washington. In addition, Trump is thought to be looking for a nominee with superior academic credentials. That could be a problem for Kethledge if what Trump really meant was that he wants an Ivy Leaguer, like the rest of the high court. Kethledge attended the University of Michigan for both undergraduate and law school.",

    "fullBody": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Theyre all younger than 55 and conservative enough to make a first cut. But the four judges who are apparently the finalists for President Donald Trumps second Supreme Court nomination are being measured against a set of questions that go well beyond age and ideology.\n\nPresidents weigh all sorts of considerations in deciding on a Supreme Court nominee, often beginning with the big question: Will the choice be confirmed by the Senate? Academic credentials, professional experience and sometimes even gender, race and geographical diversity all can be part of the equation.\n\nThe stakes are sky high for filling the opening created by Justice Anthony Kennedys imminent retirement. The new justice has the potential to entrench conservative control of the Supreme Court for years to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are some of the pluses and minuses for each of the presumed leading candidates, in alphabetical order:\n\n___\n\nAMY CONEY BARRETT, 46, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit\n\nIf Trump is looking to make history, Barrett could have some appeal. If shes chosen and confirmed, it would be the first time four women would serve together on the nine-member Supreme Court. In addition, she is the youngest of the leading candidates, and Trump has said he wants his nominee to serve for decades. Barrett, a longtime law professor at the University of Notre Dame, also served as a law clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who is beloved by conservatives. And she recently made it through the confirmation process, with the Senate approving her nomination to be an appeals court judge in October. Three Democrats voted for her then.\n\nBut Barretts recent ascension to the appeals court means she does not have the long, conservative record that lawmakers on the right find reassuring. Barrett is also seen as a potentially divisive nominee because of statements shes made about her Catholic faith and about abortion. In her 20s she co-authored a paper that said Catholic judges, if they are faithful to church teachings, are morally precluded from enforcing the death penalty. At her recent confirmation hearing, however, she said it was never permissible for judges to follow their personal convictions in deciding a case. More recently, shes written that abiding by precedent is not a hard-and-fast rule in the Supreme Courts constitutional cases. Although the statement is undoubtedly accurate, it is likely to be seized on by supporters of abortion rights as they try to convince moderate Republican senators that Barrett might vote to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision declaring a womans constitutional right to abortion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n___\n\nTHOMAS HARDIMAN, 52, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit\n\nHardiman was a runner-up when Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the high court in 2017. He might appeal to Trump if the president is looking for someone from a blue-collar background. Hardiman was the first in his family to attend college, at the University of Notre Dame, then helped pay for his law school education at Georgetown by driving a taxi. Hardiman has some notable opinions in his 11 years on the appeals court that could appeal to Trump, including upholding strip searches of jail inmates, even those arrested on minor charges, backing collection of genetic evidence from people at the time of their arrest, and dissenting from a ruling that upheld gun regulations in New Jersey.\n\nHardimans judicial chambers are in Pittsburgh, where his wife comes from a family of prominent Democrats. He also was a colleague of Trumps sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, who stopped hearing cases last year. Some conservative groups dont trust Barry because she wrote an opinion striking down a New Jersey abortion regulation in 2000, and they hope she has no influence over her brothers choice.\n\n___\n\nBRETT KAVANAUGH, 53, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\nRoughly 300 opinions in 12 years as a judge and a raft of legal articles and speaking engagements make Kavanaugh the most prolific of the prospective nominees. He is widely viewed as a skilled, conservative judge on what is often called the second most powerful court in America. His opinions include several dissents that were later vindicated by Supreme Court majority opinions. Kavanaugh, who worked on the investigation that led to President Bill Clintons impeachment, later wrote that he thinks presidents shouldnt have to deal with criminal investigations or civil lawsuits while in office \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a view that Trump might find attractive. He attended Yale both as an undergraduate and law student, and served as a law clerk to Kennedy. He is active in his local Catholic church and as a coach for his daughters basketball teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome social conservatives fear Kavanaugh isnt committed to issues that matter to them, like abortion. They cite a recent case involving a pregnant teenaged immigrant in federal custody. Kavanaugh would have delayed the teens abortion, in line with the Trump administrations position, but another judge would have gone farther and declared that, as someone who is in the U.S. illegally, the teen had no right at all to an abortion. Kavanaughs close ties to the Bush family, stemming from his five years in the White House under President George W. Bush, might not be a positive to Trump, who has sparred with the Bushes. Kavanaugh also was a clerk for Judge Alex Kozinski, who retired abruptly last year as allegations of sexual misconduct grew.\n\n___\n\nRAYMOND KETHLEDGE, 51, judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit\n\nKethledges 10 years as a federal appeals court judge give him a long record of conservative opinions that may make Trump and Republican senators feel secure about the kind of Supreme Court justice hed be. Hes written opinions siding against unions in a dues collection case, admonishing the IRS in a case about its targeting of conservative groups and okaying broad access by the government to cellphone location data, an opinion overturned last month by the Supreme Court. Hes also seen as a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.\n\nLike Kavanaugh, Kethledge is a former Kennedy clerk and would no doubt cite that experience in attempting to appeal to moderates. Kethledge also has first-hand experience with Congress. For about a year and a half in the 1990s, Kethledge was counsel to Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham of Michigan. If Kethledge is the nominee, that experience working for Congress could help in the customary courtesy visits to senators before a confirmation hearing.\n\nAt the same time, Kethledge left Washington to return to Michigan two decades ago. He probably has fewer friends in the nations capital than Kavanaugh, but Trump may put value on the fact hes an outsider and less well known in Washington. In addition, Trump is thought to be looking for a nominee with superior academic credentials. That could be a problem for Kethledge if what Trump really meant was that he wants an Ivy Leaguer, like the rest of the high court. Kethledge attended the University of Michigan for both undergraduate and law school.",

    "fullBody": "Roborace's Robocar is headed for the Goodwood Festival of Speed, where Ferraris tend to outnumber robots. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure when the car appears, people will freak out,\" the effort's CEO says.\n\nRoborace\n\nOnce a year, the bucolic grounds of Goodwood House in West Sussex, England, are consumed by the smell of exhaust fumes, the sound of engines revving, and an excited crowd of 100,000 people, all wanting a look at the special cars on show. They gather here because Charles Gordon-Lennox, the 11th Duke of Richmond, likes to occasionally open his home to host the Goodwood Festival of Speed, a celebration of all the history, the heritage, and the future of motor racing.\n\nThis week, among the supercars, hypercars, and pure racing cars, Goodwood visitors will spot a low, black machine streaking in near silence up the winding driveway to the estate, which for the event is transformed into a 1.16-mile hill climb track.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty sure when the car appears, people will freak out,\u201d says Rod Chong, deputy CEO of Roborace. And it will be the first machine to  give the hill climb a try without a human in command, so there are some nerves. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sleeping very well right now,\u201d Chong says.\n\nRobocar is an autonomous race car developed by Roborace, which is starting the world\u2019s first motorsports series for self-driving cars. Its vehicle doesn\u2019t have the constraint of keeping a human driver safe, so the design team\u2014led by Daniel Simon, known for his work on Tron: Legacy\u2014dropped the cockpit and whittled away the central spine of the vehicle. The wheels flare out at the corners, behind huge aero ducts.\n\nRoborace first unveiled its car in February 2017, with long-term plans to build a whole bunch, and pit them against one another on a track. The design uses four electric motors for a total of more than 500 horsepower. As in most self-driving prototypes, a computer tries to make sense of the world with input from lidar, GPS, cameras, and radar. Teams who want to race will use the same hardware platform but will design their own software, looking for a racing edge.\n\nRobocar was built to run on professional race courses used by Formula E, the electric racing series with which Roborace is associated. It\u2019s designed for neat and tidy pavement, clear road edges, and immobile crash barriers that can be used as reference points. Here, it will have none of those things. \u201cThe challenge with Goodwood is that it\u2019s a temporary structure that only gets built up the week of the event,\u201d Chong says. His car will have to contend with indistinct grass curbs and protective hay bales that might move if someone else crashes into them or they get kicked by the crowd.\n\nThe first big test at Goodwood comes Monday, when the team will run the track in a private test, ahead of the show days on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. \u201cMonday is the first time we\u2019ll have tested in the real environment,\u201d says Bryn Balcombe, Roborace\u2019s chief strategy officer.\n\nThe biggest issue the team anticipates is the trees. The canopy is so thick over the driveway that satellite GPS signals can\u2019t make it through the leaves, which means the car won\u2019t be able to accurately map its position. Instea, the team has written software for the hill climb that relies on lidar laser sensors for real-time environment perception. Luckily, running on the Formula E race track last December in Hong Kong gave them some experience to build on. There, the tall buildings posed a similar obstacle to GPS reception.\n\nAt Goodwood, the Roborace team plans to run the course very early each morning, before things get started, just to rescan it and check if any bales have shifted. Then they\u2019ll run the car in whatever slot they\u2019re assigned, in between the groups of touring cars, 1950s Formula 1 cars, the road-going racers, and whatever other magnificent vehicles make the trip.\n\nFor this year\u2019s outing, the team isn\u2019t looking to set any records. They\u2019ll be happy just to drive, and complete, the course three days in a row. That\u2019s not to say they\u2019re taking it slow. \u201cWe want to run to a good level of speed\u2014it\u2019ll be visually exciting, believe me,\u201d Chong says. But really it\u2019s a proof of concept and a chance to remind a petrol-head crowd that the future might be electric and autonomous, but it will definitely still be fun.\n\n------------\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\n* This nonsensical 3-wheeler might be the future of driving\n* How to free up space on your iPhone\n* The complexity of simply searching for medical advice\n* PHOTO ESSAY: 'Fire flowers' dazzle in Japan\n* Inside the crypto world's biggest scandal\n* Looking for more?

    "fullBody": "(Image: ZDNet/supplied)\n\nA popular fitness app that tracks the activity data on millions of users has inadvertently revealed the locations of personnel working at military bases and intelligence services.\n\nThe app, Polar Flow, built by its eponymous company Polar, a Finnish-based fitness tracking giant with offices in New York, allowed anyone to access a user's fitness activities over several years -- simply by modifying the browser's web address.\n\nFor most users who set their activity tracking records to public, posting their workouts on Polar's so-called Explore map is a feature and not a privacy issue. But even with profiles set to private, a user's fitness activity can reveal where a person lives.\n\nAn exposed location of anyone working at a government or military installation can quickly become a national security risk.\n\nIt's the second time this year a fitness app has sparked controversy by revealing the locations of personnel at sensitive installations. Strava was forced to pull its maps offline and change its privacy settings after word quickly spread that the fitness trackers used by military personnel were exposing the classified routes between bases on the battlefield, making it easy to launch attacks. Much of the controversy was because the companies put the onus of privacy on the user, but many are not aware their information is searchable, let alone accessible by anybody.\n\nAlthough the existence of many government installations are widely known, the identities of their employees were not.\n\nBut now, an investigation by Dutch news site De Correspondent and Bellingcat found that Polar Flow exposed their fitness tracking data. The company's developer API could be improperly queried to retrieve fitness activities, like each running and cycling session, on any user.\n\nMore from De Correspondent: This fitness app lets anyone find names and addresses for thousands of soldiers and secret agents | How we found the names and addresses of soldiers and secret agents | Why we decided to publish our findings | Check your apps\n\nWith two pairs of coordinates dropped over any sensitive government location or facility, it was possible to find the names of personnel who track their fitness activities dating as far back as 2014.\n\nThe reporters identified more than 6,400 users believed to be exercising at sensitive locations, including the NSA, the White House, MI6 in London, and the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, as well as personnel working on foreign military bases.\n\nNames of officers and agents at foreign intelligence services, like GCHQ in Cheltenham, the French DGSE in Paris, and the Russian GRU in Moscow, were also found.\n\nStaff at nuclear storage facilities, missile silos, and prisons were also spotted.\n\nDe Correspondent shared some of the data with ZDNet to examine.\n\nNot only was it possible to see exactly where a user had exercised, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where a user lived, if they started or stopped their fitness tracking as soon as they left their house.\n\nBecause there were no limits on how many requests the reporters could make, coupled with easily enumerable user ID numbers, it was possible for anyone -- including malicious actors or foreign intelligence services -- to scrape the fitness activity data on millions of users.\n\nBut they also found they could trick the API into retrieving fitness tracking data on private profiles.\n\nBagram Airfield, Afghanistan. (Image: De Correspondent/supplied)\n\nBritish Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), London. (Image: De Correspondent/supplied)\n\nIn densely populated areas such as the White House, the number of ordinary people tracking their fitness nearby is higher, adding to a lot of unwanted noise in the data, but isolated military camps and government bases produced better results..\n\nDe Correspondent explained in an additional report how easy it was to follow around one Polar user, believed to be an officer at the Dutch state intelligence service, across the world, and even locate his home address. Yet, in some countries, like the Netherlands, revealing an intelligence officer's identity is illegal, the reporters pointed out.\n\nZDNet was able to trace one person who exercised nearby to NSA headquarters in Ft. Meade. The user later started his exercise tracking as he left his house in nearby Virginia.

Meade, was found exercising close to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility.\n\nThe Dutch reporters also found the fitness tracking data of several foreign military and intelligence officers near sensitive installations in the US.\n\nThe data can build up an unsettling picture of a person's life, where they live, where they go, and open up avenues to find out more about who they are and who they know.\n\nBut while some would call it creepy and unnerving, others would call it espionage.\n\nJoseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the Center for Democracy & Technology, commented on the exposure.\n\n\"There's probably a point in our recent history or future past which you can't be a spy anymore,\" he said.\n\nAfter a private disclosure, Polar took its map offline shortly before publication.\n\nIn a statement sent by Polar chief strategy officer Marco Suvilaakso, the company said it \"recently learned that public location data shared by customers via the Explore feature in Flow could provide insight into potentially sensitive locations.\"\n\nThe company denied a leak or a breach of its systems.\n\n\"Currently the vast majority of Polar customers maintain the default private profiles and private sessions data settings, and are not affected in any way by this case,\" said the statement. \"While the decision to opt-in and share training sessions and GPS location data is the choice and responsibility of the customer, we are aware that potentially sensitive locations are appearing in public data, and have made the decision to temporarily suspend the Explore API.\"\n\nWe asked Polar if this data exposure, specifically the revealing of some home addresses on private profiles, constituted a breach of Europe's new data protection law -- known as GDPR.\n\n\"Yes, we are GDPR compliant,\" said Suvilaakso.\n\nPolar does not reveal its user figures, but De Correspondent found more than 30 million users IDs.\n\nNSA headquarters at Fort Meade, MD.

(Image: De Correspondent/supplied)\n\nDe Correspondent contacted Dutch and Finnish authorities to secure Polar's platform, while ZDNet contacted several US authorities about the data exposure.\n\nWe contacted several government departments, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees the intelligence community and its agencies. Spokesperson Charles Carithers said Thursday the ODNI was \"aware of the potential impacts\" of devices that collect and report personal and locational data.\n\n\"The use of personal fitness and similar devices by individuals engaged in US Government support is determined and directed by each agency and department,\" he said.\n\nNSA spokesperson Brynn Freeland said the agency \"has in place and enforces policies regarding the use of wearable fitness devices inside controlled work areas,\" but did not say what those policies were.\n\n\"In addition, we have an ongoing educational campaign for our workforce focusing on the relationship between technology, their privacy, and operational security,\" he said.\n\nCIA spokesperson Ryan Trapani declined to comment, or provide its guidance on the use of personal fitness devices, and the White House did not comment when reached Thursday. A spokesperson for the National Security Council also did not comment.\n\nThe FBI did not return a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment either.\n\nIn earlier statements, the department that oversees the military said it \"takes matters like these very seriously.\" Previous guidance shows military personnel are not permitted to use fitness trackers that contain Wi-Fi or cellular capabilities, but it permits Bluetooth and GPS-enabled devices that sync data to phones.\n\nPolar isn't the only fitness tracking company inadvertently exposing user data. Other fitness apps had similar issues, though the reporters said the exposures were not to the same extent as Polar.\n\nPolar apologized for the inconvenience caused by suspending the map.\n\n\"However our goal is to raise the level of privacy protection and to heighten the awareness of good personal practices when it comes to sharing GPS location data,\" the company said.\n\nGot a tip?\n\nYou can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755\u00e2\u0080\u00938849.

If it's not an affair you're hiding from your spouse, it's your highly classified place of work that's now painted in precise detail on a map for anyone to see.\n\nThat's exactly what happened when Strava, a widely used app for tracking activity and exercise, released an \"anonymized\" heatmap of all its global data in November. The map only came to light this weekend after Australian student Nathan Ruser started digging into the data. With over 3 trillion coordinates at the street level from over 27 million fitness device users, like Fitbit and Jawbone, the GPS tracking company mapped out its aggregated data over the past two years of activity to reveal some of the most visited areas. Predictably, high population areas -- like most of the US and Europe -- are brightly lit up.\n\nThat same data also illuminated a scattering of little-known locations in war zones, where US secret facilities and military bases have operations and personnel -- presumably because soldiers and staff are unknowingly uploading their fitness tracking data to Strava.\n\nThe news has prompted US-led coalition forces to reevaluate their use of fitness trackers, amid fears that enemy forces could use the data to locate troops on the ground, according to a statement obtained by the Washington Post.\n\nNed Price, a former special assistant to President Obama, said in a tweet that \"capable adversaries have almost certainly harvested this data for years.\"\n\nThat's not even the half of it.\n\nYou can see in close detail staff walking around at UK eavesdropping station GCHQ in Cheltenham. There are also walking routes of border patrols along the US-Mexican border. Pyongyang is one of the quietest capital cities in the world, but even the isolated state lights up thanks to fitness tracking activity (although, there's reportedly no tracking data at the country's primary nuclear test site). The data also shows jogging activity on the beach around a CIA annex at Mogadishu airport.\n\nEven Area 51 is on the map.\n\nA border patrol officer walking along the the US-Mexican border. (Image: Strava)\n\nFitness tracker users at GCHQ, the UK's electronic eavesdropping spy agency. (Image: Strava)\n\nAustralia's secret Pine Gap facility in Alice Springs. (Image: Strava)\n\nWe have a serious problem when millions of users' tracking data is going up to the cloud, and for the most part without the user's direct knowledge or explicit consent. Our location, whether in real-time or historical, is one of our most private data points in our lives. They can show where we work and where we live -- and even if you have \"nothing to hide,\" most people wouldn't readily give up their home addresses to a random person on the street.\n\nBut Strava's app, which ranks as one of the most popular health and fitness apps available, takes the approach of requiring users to opt-out rather than opt-in, security researchers say.\n\nIn a blanket statement given to reporters, Strava said the data \"excludes activities that have been marked as private,\" and linked to a blog post.\n\nStrava does have an option to turn off uploading tracking data, but the privacy settings -- largely public by default, according to a Quartz story from August -- are confusing at best.\n\n\"It's true that as a user, it's my responsibility to know what I'm opting into when I use a service, especially when it's free,\" said reporter Rosie Spinks. \"But the fact that it took me three rounds of emails with a support rep, a call with [the company's communications chief], and a follow-up email round with him to fully understand how to prevent strangers from seeing my running routes is troubling.\"\n\nSpinks isn't wrong. It is a user's responsibility to maintain the app's privacy settings -- what's commonly known as operational security or \"opsec\" (or \"persec\" for personal security). Given the app's primary function is to track a user's location when they're running, swimming, or exercising, a little common sense about location data sharing goes a long way.\n\nIn hindsight, maybe giving fitness trackers to your staff at a highly classified military base isn't the best idea.\n\nBut it too is the responsibility of the companies in question not to trick or deceive users into sharing their data with the world. Based on social media responses alone, many Strava users don't seem to realize that their data is being used in this way. Although the heatmap doesn't include specific users' information, it's been demonstrated that individual activity, when made public, can be accessed and scraped. It's a stark reminder that companies like Strava, and other tech giants -- Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, to name a few -- have hoards of data on users that can paint an accurate (and incriminating) view of a person's life.\n\nStrava can hide behind the claim that its app data anonymizes the user, but that doesn't help when that user is inadvertently revealing the location of sensitive facilities.\n\nGranted, in today's world of readily available aerial and satellite imagery, it's easy to argue that keeping the very existence of military and other intelligence bases classified is impossible.\n\nBut when you're working for the government, your opsec is their opsec.\n\nGot a tip?\n\nYou can send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp at 646-755\u00e2\u0080\u00938849.

    "fullBody": "Timehop has disclosed a security breach that has compromised the personal data (names and emails) of 21 million users. Around a fifth of the affected users \u2014 or 4.7M \u2014 have also had a phone number that was attached to their account breached in the attack.\n\nThe startup, whose service plugs into users\u2019 social media accounts to resurface posts and photos they may have forgotten about, says it discovered the attack while it was in progress, at 2:04 US Eastern Time on July 4, and was able to shut it down two hours, 19 minutes later \u2014 albeit, not before millions of people\u2019s data had been breached.\n\nAccording to its preliminary investigation of the incident, the attacker first accessed Timehop\u2019s cloud environment in December \u2014 using compromised admin credentials, and apparently conducting reconnaissance for a few days that month, and again for another day in March and one in June, before going on to launch the attack on July 4, during a US holiday.\n\nTimehop  publicly disclosed the breach in a blog post on Saturday, several days after discovering the attack.\n\nIt says no social media content, financial data or Timehop data was affected by the breach \u2014 and its blog post emphasizes that none of the content its service routinely lifts from third party social networks in order to present back to users as digital \u201cmemories\u201d was affected.\n\nHowever the keys that allow it to read and show users their social media content were compromised \u2014 so it has all keys deactivated, meaning Timehop users will have to re-authenticate to its App to continue using the service.\n\n\u201cIf you have noticed any content not loading, it is because Timehop deactivated these proactively,\u201d it writes, adding: \u201cWe have no evidence that any accounts were accessed without authorization.\u201d\n\nIt does also admit that the tokens could \u201ctheoretically\u201d have been used for unauthorized users to access Timehop users\u2019 own social media posts during \u201ca short time window\u201d \u2014 although again it emphasizes \u201cwe have no evidence that this actually happened\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe want to be clear that these tokens do not give anyone (including Timehop) access to Facebook Messenger, or Direct Messages on Twitter or Instagram, or things that your friends post to your Facebook wall. In general, Timehop only has access to social media posts you post yourself to your profile,\u201d it adds.\n\n\u201cThe damage was limited because of our long-standing commitment to only use the data we absolutely need to provide our service. Timehop has never stored your credit card or any financial data, location data, or IP addresses; we don\u2019t store copies of your social media profiles, we separate user information from social media content \u2014 and we delete our copies of your \u201cMemories\u201d after you\u2019ve seen them.\u201d\n\nIn terms of how its network was accessed, it appears that the attacker was able to compromise Timehop\u2019s cloud computing environment by targeting an account that had not been protected by multifactor authentication.\n\nThat\u2019s very clearly a major security failure \u2014 but one Timehop does not explicitly explain, writing only that: \u201cWe have now taken steps that include multifactor authentication to secure our authorization and access controls on all accounts.\u201d\n\nPart of its formal incident response, which it says began on July 5, was also to add multifactor authentication to \u201call accounts that did not already have them for all cloud-based services (not just in our Cloud Computing Provider)\u201d. So evidently there was more than one vulnerable account for attackers to target.\n\nIts exec team will certainly have questions to answer about why multifactor authentication was not universally enforced for all its cloud accounts.\n\nFor now, by way of explanation, it writes: \u201cThere is no such thing as perfect when it comes to cyber security but we are committed to protecting user data. As soon as the incident was recognized we began a program of security upgrades.\u201d Which does have a distinct \u2018stable door being locked after the horse has bolted\u2019 feel to it.\n\nIt also writes that it carried out \u201cthe introduction of more pervasive encryption throughout our environment\u201d \u2014 so, again, questions should be asked why it took an incident response to trigger a \u201cmore pervasive\u201d security overhaul.\n\nAlso not entirely clear from Timehop\u2019s blog post: When/if affected users were notified their information has been breached.\n\nThe company posed the blog post disclosing the security breach to its Twitter account on July 8. But prior to that its Twitter account was only noting that some \u201cunscheduled maintenance\u201d might be causing problems for users accessing the app\u2026\n\nWe are currently doing some unscheduled maintenance on Timehop. You may have some issues accesing the app until further notice. Please follow this account for updates. Thank you for your patience!\n\n\u2014 Timehop (@timehop) July 8, 2018\n\nUPDATE: maintenance is still in progress. You can expect ongoing outages as we complete this work. Apologies for any inconvenience\n\n\u2014 Timehop (@timehop) July 8, 2018\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to the company with questions and will update this post with any response.\n\nTimehop does say that at the same time as it was working to shut down the attack and tighten up its security, company executives contacted local and federal law enforcement officials \u2014 presumably to report the breach.\n\nBreach reporting requirements are baked into Europe\u2019s recently updated data protection framework, the GDPR, which puts the onus firmly on data controllers to disclose breaches to supervisory authorities \u2014 and to do so quickly \u2014 with the regulation setting a universal standard of within 72 hours of becoming aware of it (unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in \u201ca risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\u201d).\n\nReferencing GDPR, Timehop writes: \u201cAlthough the GDPR regulations are vague on a breach of this type (a breach must be \u201clikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individuals\u201d), we are being pro-active and notifying all EU users and have done so as quickly as possible. We have retained and have been working closely with our European-based GDPR specialists to assist us in this effort.\u201d\n\nThe company also writes that it has engaged the services of an (unnamed) cyber threat intelligence company to look for evidence of use of the email addresses, phone numbers, and names of users being posted or used online and on the Dark Web \u2014 saying that \u201cwhile none have appeared to date, it is a high likelihood that they will soon appear\u201d.\n\nTimehop users who are worried the network intrusion and data breach might have impact their \u201cStreak\u201d \u2014 aka the number Timehop displays to denote how many consecutive days they have opened the app \u2014 are being reassured by the company that \u201cwe will ensure all Streaks remain unaffected by this event\u201d.",
