    "fullBody": "BAMBERG -- The lofty goal of a four-year-degree pilot training program operated by Denmark Technical College is at least two years away from getting off the ground, according to Denmark Tech Interim President Dr. Christopher Hall.\n\nSpeaking at a community forum about the proposed project June 25, Hall was enthusiastic, but cautioned that a good deal of groundwork needed to be done before it could become a reality, including getting legislative approval to offer a four-year program at the college.\n\nHall did indicate, however, that Denmark Technical College has the foundational courses and programs of study that could be translated to aeronautics and avionics.\n\nWill Bradley, a South Carolina native with Bamberg roots and co-pilot with Southwest Airlines, first brought the idea to Bamberg Mayor Nancy Foster, and he was on hand Monday night to speak as well.\n\nBradley noted there is a looming pilot shortage in the United States as well as internationally, adding that the major airlines are paying top wages and attractive signing bonuses to recruit qualified pilots.\n\nFederal regulations require 1,500 hours of flight training, but graduates from an accredited four-year program only need 1,000 hours, he said.\n\nBradley said the Bamberg County Airport would be an ideal location for training students enrolled in the proposed flight school at Denmark Tech, noting flight training would be conducted with four-seater aircraft.\n\nThe airport would need to add a parallel taxiway, he said, adding that the majority of the funds for that could come from the Federal Aviation Administration, which would pay 90 percent, with the state and Bamberg County needing to provide matches of 5 percent each.\n\nBradley told the group that Southwest Airlines officials find the idea interesting, but are not yet officially backing the project. If momentum for the project continues, an onsite visit by Southwest Airlines officials is tentatively in the works for early October, he said.\n\nBamberg County Administrator Joey Preston said the county was interested in the idea, but he expressed concerns about how much of the project had already been discussed in public. He said the county airport had, in fact, been downgraded to an airfield as it has not maintained the level of usage needed to be considered a general aviation airport by the FAA.\n\nThe funding for the parallel taxiway that Bradley mentioned would not be available until the airfield is restored to airport status, Preston said.\n\nBoth Bradley and Hall said there were strong selling points for a flight school to be located in Bamberg County, including the proximity to Boeing in Charleston and the fact that aviation-related industries are the fastest growing sector in the Southeast.\n\nState Sen. Brad Hutto noted that the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s technical college system was traditionally for training residents for jobs in South Carolina, although the proximity to Charlotte Douglas International Airport could be a selling point. He also indicated that every other technical college in the state would likely be seeking permission to offer four-year degree programs.\n\nAlso during the program, Bradley announced that Southwest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Adopt-a-Pilot\" program is being expanded to include 60 students in the fifth grade at Richard Carroll Elementary School in Bamberg. The program provides students with a pilot mentor and provides an opportunity for them to explore aviation activities and related careers.",

    "fullBody": "Paris (AFP) - The French government pointed to possible security failings on Monday after a notorious gangster used a helicopter to stage his second brazen jailbreak of a crime career inspired by films such as \"Scarface\".\n\nThe latest escape of Redoine Faid, who was serving a 25-year sentence for an armed robbery in which a policewoman was killed, has left French authorities red-faced.\n\nFaid was sprung from a prison in Paris by two accomplices who used smoke bombs and angle grinders to break into the jail and whisk the fugitive to a waiting helicopter.\n\nJustice Minister Nicole Belloubet told Europe 1 radio that she had sent a team of inspectors to the jail \"to see whether the security measures were defective so that we can rectify them\".\n\nShe suggested that leaving Faid in the same prison for \"a few months\" had been a mistake.\n\n\"We must be careful not to leave the same people in the same places for too long, when we're dealing with this type of individual,\" she said.\n\n\"The rotation probably needs to be more frequent,\" she said.\n\nFaid's accomplices hijacked a helicopter from a flight school on Sunday morning and forced the terrified instructor to take them to the prison, where the aircraft hovered above the yard.\n\nTwo black-clad men armed with assault rifles then set off smoke bombs before using power tools to break into the prison's visiting room, where Faid was talking to his brother.\n\nThe wardens, who were unarmed, fled and raised the alarm. But within 10 minutes Faid had made his escape. The helicopter was later found in a northeastern suburb of Paris about 60 kilometres (37 miles) from the prison.\n\nThe pilot, who had been beaten, was found in a state of shock.\n\nThe men then continued their getaway by car, changing vehicles along the way. The first car was found torched in a shopping mall carpark.\n\nBelloubet said Sunday the gang probably used drones to stake out the prison.\n\nThe breakout comes five years after Faid blasted his way out of a prison in northern France using dynamite.\n\n- Cult following -\n\nFaid has been behind bars since mid-2011 for breaking the terms of his parole over past convictions for bank robberies and brazen heists of cash-in-transit vehicles.\n\nIn his 2013 jailbreak, he briefly took four guards hostage with a pistol before escaping in a waiting getaway car. All the hostages were released unharmed.\n\nHe was recaptured six weeks later at a hotel on the outskirts of Paris.\n\nFaid, who has a cult following in the tough multi-ethnic suburbs outside Paris where he grew up, has made several television appearances.\n\nPolice nicknamed him \"The Author\" for two books he co-wrote about his delinquent youth.\n\nAt a Paris film festival in April 2009, Faid approached Michael Mann, director of the 1995 gangster film \"Heat\" starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, telling him: \"You were my technical adviser.\"\n\nHe wrote that he had watched the film dozens of times to perfect his bank-robbing prowess.",

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo\n\nFor years, U.S. and European weapons makers funded a wide range of so-called \u201coffset agreements\u201d, or projects to sweeten weapons deals that ranged from construction of hospitals and hotels to giant orders of frozen chicken, as well as simple one-off production orders for local firms.\n\nBut purchasing countries are now demanding more complex technology transfers and a share of work on ongoing weapons programs in order to cement deals, industry executives told Reuters at the Farnborough Airshow this week.\n\nLockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, Raytheon Co and other U.S. companies have boosted their foreign orders sharply in recent years as demand for U.S. weapons has increased. The U.S. government is on track to approve nearly $40 billion in foreign military sales in the 2016 fiscal year that ends Oct. 1, a drop from $46.6 billion last year but still well above levels seen just five years ago.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be successful in any country, you have to have content in that country,\u201d said Steve O\u2019Bryan, head of business development for Lockheed Martin Corp\u2019s Mission Systems and Training, which includes Sikorsky helicopters. \u201cAnd the ones who move faster ... do better.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Bryan, a former top executive with the Lockheed F-35 fighter jet program, said that project helped create the new paradigm since it was structured from the start to allow local companies in countries that funded the jet\u2019s development and bought airplanes to compete for work on the whole aircraft.\n\nEnsuring work for domestic suppliers is a key factor in a big missile defense competition in Poland, and will likely play a huge role in a long-delayed fighter competition in Canada.\n\nLockheed\u2019s Sikorsky helicopter unit has also responded to the changing market, and is now building H-60 Black Hawk helicopters in Poland, Turkey and Japan. It also signed an agreement that could lead to a similar set up in Saudi Arabia.\n\nBoeing Co, the world\u2019s largest planemaker and the  No. 2. U.S. weapons maker, says it leveraged its 70-year commercial history in India to win large military orders when that market opened up a decade ago.\n\n\u201cWe were able to draw on the knowledge and relationships \u200efrom our commercial business to build a local manufacturing and supply base,\u201d said spokeswoman Caroline Hutcheson. \u201cWe hit the ground running and grew quickly because of the depth of our experience.\u201d\n\nBoeing broke ground last month on a joint venture with India\u2019s Tata that will build AH-64 Apache helicopter fuselages  in India as part of the government\u2019s \u201cMake in India\u201d campaign.\n\nDavid Melcher, who heads the U.S. Aerospace Industries Association trade group, said his group is urging the U.S. government to streamline and accelerate often slow approvals of arms sales and technology transfers to adjust to the shifting realities of the global arms sales market.\n\nAIA wants Washington to make it easier to export technologies that are already available elsewhere, including satellites and night vision military equipment, warning that U.S. firms could otherwise losing business to overseas rivals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m making an argument for increasing the level of capability that we\u2019re allowed to sell to our allies, and when we\u2019re allowed to sell it, to do it expeditiously and streamline the processes,\u201d he said.\n\nU.S. officials are trying to improve the process and deal with record-high levels of arms sales requests, but say they must work through requests on a case-by-case basis to safeguard U.S. security and technology.\n\nEditing by Alexandra Hudson\n\nOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo\n\nThe Super Puma, a staple of the offshore oil industry, was grounded for commercial use following the accident in which everyone on board died after the main rotor blades separated from the aircraft.\n\nAnalysts and industry executives say questions are growing over the future of at least the civil version of the Super Puma helicopter, which makes up 80 percent of the programme.\n\n\u201cOf course the product will have a future. We really believe in this product,\u201d Airbus Helicopters Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Reuters when asked about the accident, which he described as a shock for the company.\n\nNorwegian investigators have ruled out human error in the crash and have contacted European air safety authorities about a possible safety issue with the helicopter\u2019s gearbox.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, we don\u2019t know if this is design, production, maintenance or a combination of the three,\u201d Faury said.\n\n\u201cWe need to understand, to go to the bottom of the root cause and then solve the problem.\u201d\n\nEarlier generations of the Super Puma have 5.3 million flight hours over 30 years, said Faury in an interview at the Farnborough Airshow.\n\nSafety experts caution that it is too early to say exactly what caused the helicopter\u2019s rotor blades to detach and send the aircraft plunging onto the rocky coastline off Bergen.\n\nThe last such disaster involved an earlier version of Super Puma off Aberdeen in 2009, in which 16 people died.\n\nIn 2012, Super Pumas were grounded after two ditchings in the UK North Sea later blamed on gearbox cracks.\n\n\u201cWe suspect that the Super Puma brand has been permanently undermined by the accidents, rather as the Chinook was damaged by accidents in the North Sea and was eventually withdrawn from offshore service,\u201d said Agency Partners analysts in a note, referring to a 1986 UK crash which killed 45 oil workers.\n\nOthers say Sikorsky, a unit of Lockheed Martin Corp, could benefit from negative publicity surrounding the Airbus Helicopters H225 and Bell Helicopter\u2019s new 525, which crashed during testing earlier this month, killing both test pilots.\n\nSikorsky this week signed a 10-year agreement to provide extended support to Bristow Helicopters for its S-92 fleet, and a separate 10-year agreement with Babcock Mission Critical Services Ltd, also for the S-92.\n\nA rebound in oil prices has not been sufficient to boost demand for helicopters in the oil and gas sector, where companies continue to cut costs, Faury said.\n\n\u201cThere is overcapacity in the helicopter sector for supplying the oil and gas [sector] and I don\u2019t anticipate that things will change in 2016 and in 2017,\u201d Faury said.\n\nEven with a reasonable increase in the oil price, it would take time before investment restarts, he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe we have reached the bottom of the crisis as far as the helicopter industry is concerned but I am not speculating that things will rebound quickly.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Andrea Shalal, Writing by Conor Humphries; editing by Mark Potter and David Clarke\n\nOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Malloy said.\n\nThe Waterford resident has led the Eastern Connecticut chamber since 2002, working to represent the local business community and improve the region's economic standing.\n\nSheridan, 72, previously worked as a human resources director at New London's Connecticut College, and as a consultant for Northeast Utilities, now Eversource Energy. He was also a community relations manager at the Millstone nuclear power plant.\n\nHe earned his bachelor's degree from Connecticut College and a master's degree from the University of New Haven.\n\nMalloy said Sheridan is a \"natural fit\" to lead the board that oversees the Connecticut Airport Authority (CAA), a group established in 2011 to attract more new airlines to Bradley International Airport, given his experience working with the business community.\n\nThe CAA was also created to develop, improve and operate the state's five general aviation airports in Danielson, Groton-New London, Hartford-Brainard, Waterbury-Oxford and Windham.\n\nMonday's appointment comes after Bradley officials unveiled a $1.4 billion master plan earlier this year that would allow the airport to serve millions of additional passengers.\n\nIt represents CAA's first master plan since it took over Bradley operations from the state Department of Transportation in 2013.",

    "fullBody": "Preliminary Reports\n\nOne Survivor Rescued from Jungle Accident Scene\n\nAgusta Bell AB206B, May 2, 2018 }, Cacao, French Guiana\u2014Two fatalities have been confirmed after a helicopter operated by Pilot Air crashed in dense forest during a daytime flight to a remote gold mine. The sole survivor was immediately airlifted to the hospital in Cayenne in critical condition. The flight was transporting two maintenance workers to the mine not far from the accident site.\n\nSignals from the helicopter's emergency locator transmitter were detected after radio contact with the control tower at the F\u00e9lix Ebou\u00e9 de Rochambeau airport was lost. The wreckage was located by the \"Dragon 973\" search-and-rescue helicopter about four hours later. The survivor's identity has not been reported. The wreckage was subsequently recovered, and the accident is under investigation by the French Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses (BEA).\n\nFalcon Clips Wingtips on Approach\n\nDassault Falcon 900EX, May 3, 2018, Johannesburg, South Africa\u2014During a crosswind landing on Runway 17 of Johannesburg's Germiston-Rand Airport, the left wingtip scraped the runway. A subsequent inspection revealed damage to the right wingtip as well. Investigators surmised that the right wing had struck treetops as the pilot banked more steeply to avoid overshooting the base-to-final turn. Necessary repairs included replacing the slats and ailerons on both wings as well as both wingtips. No injuries were reported.\n\nTwo Killed in Himalayan Caravan Crash\n\nCessna 208B, May 16, 2018, Simikot, Nepal\u2014Both pilots were killed when a Makalu Air cargo flight hit a mountainside near Simikot Pass at an elevation of 12,800 feet. The accident site in the Humla district is in one of the most remote parts of Nepal, with little access except by light aircraft.\n\nThe Cessna Caravan freighter departed the Surkhet airport for Simikot at 6:12 a.m., a flight expected to take about 45 minutes. Due to the lack of witnesses and reporting stations in the vicinity, weather conditions at the time of the accident remain unknown.\n\nFinal Reports\n\nRunway Collision Tied to Flaws in Notam System\n\nHawker 400, Dec. 23, 2015, Telluride, Colorado\u2014Weaknesses in the systems used to disseminate Notices to Airmen (Notams) contributed significantly to the ground collision between a Mexican-registered Hawker 400 and a snowplow, the NTSB concluded. The Board pointed to technical shortcomings that allow newly issued NOTAMs\u2014in this case, one closing the airport for snow removal\u2014to escape the attention of air traffic controllers. The accident flight was cleared for an instrument approach eight minutes after airport staff issued a Notam closing the field. The jet struck the snowplow from behind during its landing roll, separating the airplane's right wing but causing only minor damage to the plow. There were no injuries to the two pilots, five passengers, or snowplow operator.\n\nThe closure Notam was posted via computer two minutes after the approach controller, whose workload was described as \"heavy,\" asked the flight crew whether they had current weather and Notam information and provided vectors for their arrival. The NTSB's report noted that while Notams immediately became available to the controller, his display system did not automatically alert him of new Notams affecting the airports in his sector. Instead, the controller would have had to switch his display to a different screen, not practical while working multiple arrivals and departures at several fields. Before installation of the current system, airport operators had notified ATC of airport or runway closures by telephone.\n\nAlso contributing to the accident was the pilots' failure to change to the airport's Common Traffic Advisory Frequency and request traffic advisories after canceling their IFR flight plan.\n\nOpen Hatch, Pilot Distraction Blamed for Meridian Crash\n\nPiper PA-46-500TP, Dec. 24, 2015, Corinth, Mississippi\u2014A pilot distracted by an open access hatch on the engine cowling stalled the single-engine turboprop while attempting to turn back to the runway, according to the NTSB. The access door on the right side of the cowling had been left open by an airport lineman \"as he always did\" after disconnecting the aircraft from a battery charger; the pilot should have closed and latched it during his preflight inspection. The pilot and his daughter escaped with minor injuries after the airplane hit a tree and crashed into the yard of a vacant house. His wife and their daughter-in-law were knocked unconscious by the impact, and the daughter-in-law succumbed to head injuries 227 days later.\n\nThe pilot reported reducing power after seeing the door \"flopping up and down,\" only to have it open completely during a left turn to crosswind. At that point, he said, the airplane would not maintain altitude with full power, so he \"put the nose back down.\" A witness described the airplane flying \"real slow\" with its wings \"wagging\" before the left wing dropped and it fell into the trees. Data recovered from the airplane's avionics suite showed it reaching a maximum speed of 102 knots at an altitude of 507 feet, then slowing to 80 knots as it entered a 45-degree left bank. The landing gear remained down and locked. The manufacturer's test flight data showed that with the landing gear down and the flaps in the 10-degree takeoff position, the airplane would stall at 79 knots in a wings-level attitude and 95 knots in a 45-degree bank.\n\nA checklist found by the pilot's rudder pedals had been issued by a simulator training provider and was not authorized for use in the aircraft. Its only reference to the aircraft's exterior read, \"EXTERIOR PREFLIGHT \u2026 COMPLETE.\" A detailed checklist for the preflight inspection appears in the Pilot's Operating Handbook, which was found in the cabinet behind the pilot's seat. The pilot's daughter-in-law, who had been in the left rear seat, was found on the floor between the rear and middle seat rows. Her seat belt was unlatched with no indication of strain or damage, suggesting it was not fastened during the flight.\n\nHelicopter Pilot Failedo Reverse Course\n\nAerospatiale AS355F1, March 29, 2017, Snowdonia, Wales\u2014Echoing the findings of Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, a coroner's inquest in Caernarfon, Gwynedd, confirmed that the pilot of the privately owned Twin Squirrel helicopter flew into clouds while approaching a mountainside rather than changing course to remain in visual conditions. Businessman Kevin Burke; his wife; Ruth; his brothers Donald and Barry; and Donald's wife, Sharon, were killed instantly when his helicopter hit the southeast face of the Rhynog Fawr mountain at an elevation of 2,060 feet, about 300 feet below its summit. The family was traveling from Bedfordshire to the Weston Airport in Dublin to attend a christening; their aircraft was reported missing after they did not arrive as expected.\n\nBurke held a private pilot license with night rating and had an estimated 3,650 hours of flight experience. He was not IFR-qualified, but during his most recent license proficiencyc heck he had demonstrated his ability to maintain altitude while making turns without visual references, simulating an escape from inadvertent entry into instrument conditions. The helicopter was not equipped with a terrain awareness and warning system, and the terrain alerting function on its Garmin 430 GPS had never been installed. The published maximum elevation figure for the area of the accident site was 3,300 feet.\n\nA GPS-derived altitude profile showed the helicopter staying below 1,500 feet until it had passed abeam the Birmingham airport, consistent with the forecast and reported low ceilings near its point of departure. It climbed to a maximum altitude of 3,000 feet as it passed the RAF base at Shawbury, then began a gradual descent that accelerated in the last five minutes before impact. A witness four miles from the scene saw it fly into the clouds.\n\nPhysical evidence indicated that the aircraft was under control of the autopilot at the moment of impact. The AAIB suggested that Burke's last sight of the ground might have been over lower terrain and that a failure to monitor his position on either the panel-mounted GPS or the aviation applications on his iPad would have left him unaware of the ridges just ahead. Northwest Wales coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones added, \"Unfortunately the vertical profile shows the aircraft descending to a height where it was virtually inevitable it would collide with one of the ridges in that area.\"\n\nPilatus Oil Loss Traced to Incorrect Seal Installation\n\nPilatus PC-12, Aug. 7, 2017, Meekatharra, Western Australia\u2014A maintenance technician's reliance on his memory of the disassembly and the Pratt & Whitney Canada illustrated parts catalog rather than the maintenance manual led him to install parts in the wrong order, causing failure of the propeller shaft seal shortly after takeoff. The Royal Flying Doctor Service air ambulance flight returned to land safely at the Meekatharra Airport in Western Australia after the pilot noticed a spray of oil on the windshield during climb-out. The leakage increased enough to obscure his forward vision during the final approach to landing.\n\nInvestigators for the Australian Transport Safety Board found that the engineer had installed a half-flat spacer forward of the seal instead of aft, exposing the seal to accelerated wear from direct contact with the seal runner. The investigation confirmed that the parts catalog was not intended to serve as a reference for seal replacement and did not show the parts in their actual installed positions. Fatigue on the part of the technician, who had worked 23 of the preceding 27 days and acknowledged sleeping poorly the night before performing the work, may also have contributed to the error. The seal replacement was initiated after consultation with a supervisor to correct an earlier oil leak whose source could not readily be identified.",

Representatives of the Civil Air Patrol and the Academy of Model Aeronautics were also on hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are trying to just spark an interest in the aviation field,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said airport manager Brian McMillen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt really is a fun field; most people who get started in aviation don't leave it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAccording to a study released by airline manufacturers Boeing and Airbus, the industry is slated to need 617,000 new pilots by 2035, mostly in the East Asian market. But the need is also felt in the United States and elsewhere in the world.\n\nAnother study released by the University of Nebraska-Omaha in 2015 found the top three reasons new pilots aren't entering the field of commercial aviation is because of the high cost of flight training, low pay at regional carriers and a 2013 change that mandated a six-fold increase in flight hours required by first officers.\n\nMcMillen said the situation is somewhat dire as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cgray tsunami,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is coming \u00e2\u0080\u0094 older pilots leaving the field, leaving airlines struggling to find trained pilots.\n\nThe stunt plane flights were also a way to try and get people less afraid of flying, by showing what aircraft are really capable of, more than just a quick hop across state lines.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut maybe seeing all that might work in the opposite way now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d McMillen joked.\n\nNeal Porter brought his two children to see the air show Saturday, which was free except for a $10 parking fee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was just something fun to do with the kids, and it was really affordable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Porter said.\n\nJamie Porter, his wife, added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt gets them out of the house and off of the couch.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nKrystal Davis came out to the air show with her husband Rodney Davis and 7-year-old son Parker.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe really likes model cars\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but I just wanted to see the air show up close,\" she said. \"It's pretty cool, It's a good family event.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

    "fullBody": "At least four people, including a patient, were taken to Chicago hospitals after an air ambulance helicopter crash-landed along Interstate 57 in the citys Fernwood neighborhood, Chicago Fire Department officials said.\n\nThe original patient was in critical condition, while three crew members were stable, said Deputy District Chief Walter Schroeder.\n\nThe Eurocopter 135 air ambulance crashed about 9:15 p.m., according to a statement released by the Federal Aviation Administration, which stated it was sending investigators to the scene to try to determine the cause.\n\nThe red helicopter appeared to have landed on its belly in the grassy median where the interstate splits, near Wentworth Avenue between 98th and 99th streets.\n\nThe cause of the crash is under investigation, said Fire Department Deputy District Chief Lynda Turner. I think the pilot did an excellent job of landing a helicopter that was in an emergency situation, she said.\n\nThe pilot made a mayday call before landing, Schroeder said.\n\nThree of the four on board had already made it out of the helicopter when firefighters arrived, Turner said. They got the last patient out and took two to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn and two to University of Chicago Medical Center, she said.\n\nPeople gathered along an overpass south of the scene, watching as law enforcement cars lined up along the interstate and trying to catch a glimpse of the fallen helicopter.\n\nAmong the onlookers were Nadira and Mike Crown, who said they were walking their dog in their Beverly neighborhood when they started hearing sirens. They returned home and turned on the TV, and after learning of the helicopter crash, they drove to the overpass.\n\nThey were simply curious, just gawking, Mike Crown said.\n\nFire companies were transporting the patients as Illinois State Police secured the scene, the Fire Department tweeted.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board was notified, according to the FAA.\n\nCrime in Chicago: Explore your community\n\nTracking Chicago shooting victims\n\nThe Chicago Tribune crime team tracks shooting victims in Chicago.
