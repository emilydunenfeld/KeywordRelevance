    "fullBody": "Gregory Meyer in New York and Philip Stafford in London\n\nJuly 2, 2018\nPrint this page\n\nSome of the most active traders on global derivatives exchanges are scaling back their positions as their banks clamp down in the face of new regulations.\u00c2\n\nEuropean banks and prime brokers have begun to apply new capital rules under international standards known as Basel III. The impact came into focus last week with news that Geneva Energy Markets, a large New York-based proprietary trader in oil derivatives, had shut after its bank directed it to cut its holdings. Industry executives wonder whether others will follow.\u00c2\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think GEM is the first example of a firm that is closing its doors because it can't operate as it once did,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rob Creamer, chief executive of Geneva Trading, a Chicago-based proprietary trader that was formerly affiliated with GEM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect there will probably be more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\n\nThe new Basel rules restrict netting of futures and options trades, or the ability to subtract the risk of offsetting positions against one another. Instead, they treat positions as a gross exposures to the market, magnifying the reported risk for bank-owned derivatives brokers, known as FCMs.\u00c2\n\nTo comply with the rules banks are forcing proprietary traders, typically the highest-volume clients, to reduce their exposure. Electronic market makers dominate daily trading on global markets, representing up to 40 per cent of turnover.\n\nThe effect is especially pronounced in markets for options, which confer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a futures contract or security at a set price by a given date, traders said. Last year worldwide open interest in options contracts increased by 9 per cent to 602m contracts, compared to fractional growth in futures contracts to 237m, according to\u00c2 FIA, an industry body.\u00c2\n\nEnergy options have been especially susceptible to stricter capital rules because they often have relatively high notional value, according to a brokerage executive.\u00c2\n\nMr Creamer said the changes, which began this year, were affecting how markets function. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUnusual trading activity is taking place as people are exiting positions they otherwise wouldn't have to. You're seeing things trade out of areas of value because of regulation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\n\nGeneva Trading backed GEM when it was launched in 2008, but withdrew its stake this year. In May the Chicago-based company sued GEM in a dispute over their obligations to one another. Mr Creamer and Mark Vonderheide, GEM's managing partner, declined to comment on the lawsuit.\u00c2\n\nThe legal complaint identified Dutch-based\u00c2 ABN Amro as GEM's clearing bank and noted that \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew, specific targets\u00e2\u0080\u009d for bank leverage \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould put severe strain on GEM's business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d ABN Amro declined to comment.\u00c2\n\nFutures industry executives argue the Basel standard is a blunt tool that could cripple derivatives businesses and curb market liquidity. One European options trading executive described it as having a \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrutal\u00e2\u0080\u009d effect on local brokers, who were warning they were lowering customers credit limits.\u00c2\n\nA competitor of GEM in the oil derivatives market said his firm also reduced its position this year because of pressure from a bank-owned FCM. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's been very difficult for everybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\u00c2\n\nThe clampdown has created an opening for independent brokers to win business. The broker Wedbush has been running advertisements highlighting its status as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cUS-domiciled, non-bank FCM\u00e2\u0080\u009d available for \u00e2\u0080\u009cless-restricted trading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00c2\n\nBob Fitzsimmons, Wedbush executive vice-president, said that in the past several weeks \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe are seeing movement of customer business coming from European-owned bank FCMs\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Most of the new customers have been proprietary trading firms, he said.",

Another is intervention by major central banks through quantitative easing (QE)\u2014 massive bond-buying programs.\n\nA big concern for years has been that another major world market hiatus would once again expose the vulnerability at the financial system\u2019s core, amplifying any global selloff.\n\nLiquidity hiccups have already roiled emerging and junk-rated bonds in recent years. But Italy\u2019s upheaval at the end of May showed that parts of the vast, historically stable market for Western sovereign bonds has also become prone to seizure whenever turbulence strikes.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Italy should teach portfolio managers that liquidity comes at a price,\u201d Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a fund  manager at BNP Paribas, said.\n\nEuro zone government bond trading volumes have nearly halved in the past four years to 676 billion euros in June, from 1.29 trillion euros in June 2014, data from Trax, a unit of bond trading platform MarketAxess, showed.\n\nMeanwhile, the bid-offer spread \u2014 the difference between prices investors quote to buy and sell, a common liquidity gauge \u2014 remains low but has widened. Even for Germany\u2019s 10-year Bund, the region\u2019s most-traded bond, bid-offer levels on cash prices are now 15 to 30 cents, compared with 5 to 10 cents from 2013 to 2015.\n\nSome of that slide was caused by the European Central Bank. Its 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme has swallowed a big chunk of new supply since 2015.\n\nWith bond purchases ending this year, many expect liquidity to improve. That seems to have happened in U.S. markets since QE ended there. The average daily Treasury volumes in the first five months of 2018 rose 4.7 percent from the same period in 2017 to $554.3 billion, trade body Sifma says.\n\nBut broadly, the liquidity drought is also symptomatic of a bigger problem after new rules effectively forced banks to reduce the pre-crisis \u201cmarket-making\u201d practice of holding bonds on their own books until buyers appear to lubricate trading.\n\nThe Basel III rules, drawn up in 2009, forced banks to hold more capital against the risks they took, in turn making it costlier to hold inventories.\n\nMany see this as actually increasing market vulnerability. In the May 29 blowout, when buying interest for Italian debt evaporated, bid-offer yield spreads ballooned, peaking at 30 basis points versus 0-5 bps in normal times.\n\nSeveral banks have stepped back from primary dealing roles, partly due to regulatory pressures..\n\n\u201cThe role of market makers is still important, but you cannot rely on them,\u201d Lamy said.\n\nSome also blame the growing role of computer-powered high-frequency traders as market makers in place of banks; they are often accused of stopping quoting prices when spreads widen sharply.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Steady decline in trading, euro zone and Italy - reut.rs/2ILzsgl)\n\nThere are signs of reduced liquidity in the $5 trillion-a-day currency market, too. The sterling \u201cflash crash\u201d in October 2016 and the Swiss franc surge in January 2015 are prominent examples of recent liquidity squeezes. But two London-based bank FX trading heads said mini intra-day \u201cflash crash\u201d-style moves occurred far more frequently than investors realized.\n\nTwice this year, the number of multiple standard-deviation moves - measuring unusually large price changes - across major bond, FX and stock markets has passed levels that were exceeded only twice in the preceding five years, Japanese bank Nomura estimates.\n\n\u201cAll these bank risk rules ... means that some banks, when a certain security goes above a certain volatility, they stop quoting it,\u201d said Said Haidar, CEO of New York hedge fund Haidar Capital Management. \u201cThat means some of the market-makers disappear from the market when you need liquidity most.\u201d\n\nBALLOONING SPREADS\n\nOf May 29, as fears grew that Italy would quit the euro, dealers at banks and hedge funds painted a picture of a market in panic mode. The spike in short-dated Italian bond yields was the biggest since 1992, surpassing any day during the 2009-2013 European crisis.\n\nKaspar Hense, a fund manager at $61 billion BlueBay Asset Management, said he watched Italian bid-offer spreads surge to between 15 and 20 basis points from the normal 2 to 3 bps as buyers and sellers disappeared.\n\n\u201cNormally you wouldn\u2019t even trade an asset with that sort of spread,\u201d Hense said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Italian bid/offer spread balloons as political crisis hits - reut.rs/2KBf2Z5)\n\nEven now, selling a big tranche of Italian debt, say $200 million worth, remains near-impossible and \u201cfruitless\u201d, said Louis Gargour, CIO of hedge fund LNG Capital.\n\nThat was not the case in previous years, Gargour said, adding: \u201cIf you are a large fund, selling significant amount of BTPs (Italian government bonds) into market weakness is difficult and is likely to exaggerate price moves against you.\u201d\n\nDISAPPEARING INVENTORY\n\nCurrent data on European banks\u2019 bond-trading inventories is difficult to find, but the Bank for International Settlements estimated in 2016 that U.S. primary dealers had cut net Treasuries positions by nearly 80 percent since 2013.\n\nAnd dealers\u2019 holdings of U.S. corporate bonds are now less than one percent of the total outstanding, versus 10 percent in 2008, Gavekal Research said.\n\nWhat\u2019s of concern is that recent episodes of disappearing liquidity \u2014 February\u2019s volatility spike and a late-2016 sterling \u201cflash crash\u201d - happened during a multi-year bull run on world markets.\n\nNow with economic growth possibly slowing and central banks withdrawing stimulus, the next hit may strike when the market backdrop is less benign.\n\nAdditional reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe and Maiya Keidan; Graphics by Abhinav Ramnarayan; Editing by Sujata Rao, Larry King\n\nOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

Another is intervention by major central banks through quantitative easing (QE)\u2014 massive bond-buying programmes.\n\nA big concern for years has been that another major world market hiatus would once again expose the vulnerability at the financial system\u2019s core, amplifying any global selloff.\n\nLiquidity hiccups have already roiled emerging and junk-rated bonds in recent years. But Italy\u2019s upheaval at the end of May showed that parts of the vast, historically stable market for Western sovereign bonds has also become prone to seizure whenever turbulence strikes.\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Italy should teach portfolio managers that liquidity comes at a price,\u201d Arnaud-Guilhem Lamy, a fund  manager at BNP Paribas, said.\n\nEuro zone government bond trading volumes have nearly halved in the past four years to 676 billion euros in June, from 1.29 trillion euros in June 2014, data from Trax, a unit of bond trading platform MarketAxess, showed.\n\nMeanwhile, the bid-offer spread \u2014 the difference between prices investors quote to buy and sell, a common liquidity gauge \u2014 remains low but has widened. Even for Germany\u2019s 10-year Bund, the region\u2019s most-traded bond, bid-offer levels on cash prices are now 15 to 30 cents, compared with 5 to 10 cents from 2013 to 2015.\n\nSome of that slide was caused by the European Central Bank. Its 2.6 trillion-euro bond-buying scheme has swallowed a big chunk of new supply since 2015.\n\nWith bond purchases ending this year, many expect liquidity to improve. That seems to have happened in U.S. markets since QE ended there. The average daily Treasury volumes in the first five months of 2018 rose 4.7 percent from the same period in 2017 to $554.3 billion, trade body Sifma says.\n\nBut broadly, the liquidity drought is also symptomatic of a bigger problem after new rules effectively forced banks to reduce the pre-crisis \u201cmarket-making\u201d practice of holding bonds on their own books until buyers appear to lubricate trading.\n\nThe Basel III rules, drawn up in 2009, forced banks to hold more capital against the risks they took, in turn making it costlier to hold inventories.\n\nMany see this as actually increasing market vulnerability. In the May 29 blowout, when buying interest for Italian debt evaporated, bid-offer yield spreads ballooned, peaking at 30 basis points versus 0-5 bps in normal times.\n\nSeveral banks have stepped back from primary dealing roles, partly due to regulatory pressures..\n\n\u201cThe role of market makers is still important, but you cannot rely on them,\u201d Lamy said.\n\nSome also blame the growing role of computer-powered high-frequency traders as market makers in place of banks; they are often accused of stopping quoting prices when spreads widen sharply.\n\nThere are signs of reduced liquidity in the $5 trillion-a-day currency market, too.

The executives, who hold positions in human resources, consumer goods, sales and marketing, will visit the university July 8-20 and take part in executive leadership seminars on marketing and management practices at the university's accredited College of Business Administration.\n\n\"Brazilian business professionals pride themselves on creativity and practicing new ideas,\" said College of Business Administration Director of Student Leadership Initiatives Kevin Smith in a news release. \"Their visit to the CBA will give them the necessary tools they need to grow professionally and further succeed in their respective careers. Personal progress is a huge value in the Brazilian culture.\"\n\nCollege of Business Administration faculty members will lead educational seminars for the program on topics such as \"Innovating in Turbulent Times,\" \"Strategizing in Emerging Markets,\" \"Leading Change,\" \"Marketing Analytics\" and \"Building Business Relationships in a Post-Global World.\" The visiting executives also will receive business-English terminology training to help hone their conversation skills.\n\nStudents at the university's College of Business Administration who volunteer for the training program will have the opportunity to engage with the executives.\n\n\"The students who volunteer during the seminars will be experiencing not only executive interactions, but also will begin to develop relationships and understand perspectives from a different culture and country,\" said Andrew Platt in a news release. Platt is the College of Business Administration's executive director of Corporate Outreach and Professional Development. \"They will have the opportunity to observe similarities and differences in both business and social situations either in class or through some of the evening activities and events. We think it can be a 'study-in' abroad type experience for them.\"\n\nIn addition to educational seminars, visiting executives are scheduled to visit the Bridgestone Innovation Center, the Akron-Canton Regional Foodbank and the Ohio Army National Guard's Camp Ravenna Joint Military Training Center. At the training center, the executives will participate in a field-leadership reaction course to help build problem-solving skills in a team-based format.\n\n\"This training is about more than the subject matter of marketing and management,\" Smith said in a news release. \"The professionals coming to the College of Business Administration are becoming leaders in their own industries and among their peers with advanced leadership training and business-English skills.\"\n\nWant more Akron news?

    "fullBody": "There's something to be said about how the NFL is constructed in today's sports world. Billionaire owners reaping the benefits of the most-popular sports product in North America. With league-wide revenue having reached $14 billion last season, the NFL outpaces every other major professional sports league in the continent. Even then, players themselves are not being rewarded at a fair clip.\n\nThe basics of this are by now well known. Unlike the NBA and MLB, professional football players are not rewarded with fully guaranteed contracts. In fact, the three-year deal Kirk Cousins received from the Minnesota Vikings back in March was the first such fully guaranteed multi-year deal in league history.\n\nDon't think this is lost on NFL players. As the league prepares for a new season, some high-profile veterans are speaking out against the current landscape as it relates to contracts around the NFL.\n\n\"I will never understand how billionaire team owners have convinced the public that the players, who put their bodies on the line every week and make less than 50% of league revenue, are the 'ungrateful' ones,\" Los Angeles Chargers left tackle Russell Okung explained on his Twitter account. \"Considering football\u2019s level of brute, immanent physicality, high turnover as well as the short life cycle of its participants, it would seem to me that NFL players are in the most need of fully guaranteed contracts.\"\n\nThis has been an argument used by multiple players in the past. Given that NFLers do boast the shortest shelf lives of the four major sports, one might think that fully guaranteed contracts should have already taken hold.\n\nThe share of revenue players have received under the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement has been capped at 48.5 percent with a lower limit of 47 percent, via Pro Player Insiders. On the other hand, the current NBA Collective Bargaining Agreement splits revenue down the middle with owners and players each receiving 50 percent.\n\n\"Many argue that trying to compare the league-player dynamic in the NFL with other sports is apples to oranges. Yes and no. League revenues are skyrocketing, a monster media rights deal is on the horizon, the business of football will never be the same,\" Okung added. \"It\u2019s up to us, the players, to decide if we want league ownership to finally respect us as partners. Truth is, there is NOTHING preventing agents from negotiating a fully guaranteed salary for an NFL player (see Kirk Cousins deal).\"\n\nThat's the crux of the issue. There's nothing in the current CBA that disables a players' ability to receive a fully guaranteed long-term contract. Instead, it's just the current construct of the league. Given that league-wide revenue has increased from $4.28 billion back in 2001 to $14 billion, there's every reason to believe that the players and their union will push back against the narrative that said players shouldn't receive guaranteed deals.\n\nLos Angeles Rams running back and reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year Todd Gurley agrees. In fact, he takes it one step further than Okung. He just recently told TMZ Sports that players will have to strike in order to get fully guaranteed contracts.\n\nThe current CBA runs through the 2020 season, at which point it seems a work stoppage is inevitable. It's in this that a weakened NFLPA head in DeMaurice Smith had previously indicated that a work stoppage is \"almost a virtual certainty.\" This came at about the same time that Richard Sherman noted that players will have to strike to change the dynamics \u2014 a statement the NFLPA agreed with.\n\nBack to Okung for a second, because his points raise even more questions.\n\n\"Players want guaranteed money? Great! Rewrite the CBA. That\u2019s right, we need an overhaul not a revision or an extension. Why? For starters: the current CBA uses an antiquated revenue accounting method and salary cap rules take up a significant part of our collective bargaining agreement,\" the former Pro Bowler noted. \"One part of ownership\u2019s reluctance to give players guaranteed money is the structure of our cap system, the \u201ccap\u201d consists of an intricate series of accounting rules that does not fully reflect actual transfers to the pockets of players.\"\n\nIn layman's terms, Okung is using the argument that a salary cap negatively impacts the players primarily because owners push back against the idea of guaranteeing deals to players over the long term.\n\nIn a violent sport, one that sees serious injuries, we understand where the owners are coming from. But can the NFL itself exist without a salary cap in the modern sports world? The answer to this question is an obvious no. Not all owners are created equal in terms of net worth. The difference between say Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and the York family in San Francisco is vast.\n\nMarket size is also a major factor here. As we've seen in Major League Baseball, there's a tremendous discrepancy between the payrolls of teams in huge markets and those who exist in smaller markets. Again, looking at the Bay Area, the Oakland Athletics come to mind. They simply can't compete with the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers of the world from a financial perspective. In an uncapped NFL, the Green Bay Packers and Jacksonville Jaguars of the world would be playing catch-up in a big way. That's not sustainable.\n\nThere's no obvious resolution to this issue. Players are not going to agree to an extended CBA unless there's some guarantees included in it. Owners are not going to rework the current CBA to cater to the players. It's in this that a work stoppage does seem imminent.\n\nWhether that happens once the current CBA expires in 2021 or before remains to be seen. But the comments from both Okung and Gurley seem to indicate that we're headed in that direction.",

We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call those assumptions.\n\nThis chart shows how things will change. Treasurys will go from about a 40 percent weighting to 50.5 percent in 10-years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 time. Note that this doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow for an increase in our debt based on, say, a recession or revenue growth slowing relative to the Congressional Budget Office\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecasts. Conversely, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow for any optimism of growth coming in faster than expected\u00c2 with revenues gaining accordingly.\n\nLast year, in a Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee presentation, the group offered a projection of the weighted average maturity of marketable debt outstanding. What they saw was a rise from 70.8 months a year ago to about 84 months in 10 years. I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about right, too. Between relatively low historical rates and, presumably, a flatter curve for a while, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent for Treasury to issue more long-term debt (10-year Treasurys and 30-year Treasurys) and debt of a longer maturity (say, 40-year Treasurys or 50-year Treasurys). And, anyway, the government seems to have little inhibition in kicking the proverbial deficit can down the road.\n\nAre you with me so far? If you are, you have a sense of how much Treasurys will be of the taxable bond market and that the average maturity of Treasurys is likely to increase. What this means for a broad index, like the Bloomberg Aggregate is that investors, especially the growing category of passive bond investors, will have to buy more and more Treasurys to keep pace with the index and, likely, those Treasurys will have a longer and longer average maturities, thus providing a forced buying class, which should dampen rate gains to longer-term Treasurys, in other words, a backstop.\n\nA sideshow to the big show is how this has behaved in the recent past. So, Treasurys rose to 40 percent of the market in the last 10 years due to both increased issuance and, more importantly, diminished issuances in MBS, Agencies and ABS. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see those coming back, nor do I see new asset classes coming to the fore. In fact, I imagine we could see a slowing in the pace of some issuances (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m thinking corporates). With the Fed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s balance sheet reduction, the risk is that more of that influence boosts the allocation more than projected and sooner than forecast.\u00c2\n\nConsider the last 10 years yet again.

    "fullBody": "Australia's main rural lenders face numerous findings of misconduct over their treatment of struggling farmers.\n\nIn a damning assessment of the sector, counsel assisting the banking royal commission Rowena Orr, QC, pointed to numerous failings of banks to act fairly, reasonably and ethically.\n\nThe banks under the microscope include ANZ, CBA, NAB, Bendigo Bank's Rural Bank and Rabobank.\n\nThe assessment come after two weeks of hearings in Brisbane and Darwin involving case studies of agri-business lending to 13 farming families from Tasmania to the Top End.\n\nThe common theme across Ms Orr's invitation to Commissioner Kenneth Hayne to find misconduct among the banks was poor culture, lack of empathy and lax lending practices and systems.\n\nCBA claimed to breach code of conduct\n\nThe initial focus of the farm-based hearings was ANZ's acquisition of the specialist rural lender Landmark in 2009.\n\nMs Orr said up until late 2014 ANZ relied on external law firms to deal with customers in financial difficulty.\n\n\"It [ANZ] took a less flexible approach in dealing with these customers and demonstrated a lack of empathy and understanding of farmers' emotional connection to the land and the emotional impact that recoveries and enforcement actions can have on agri-business customers,\" Ms Orr said.\n\nIncreasing interest rates, as ANZ did, increased the financial burden, she said.\n\nThe CBA faces findings of misconduct over its subsidiary Bankwest and at least five breaches of the banking code of conduct over conflicted advice and remuneration practices.\n\nMs Orr said a key focus was Bankwest's policy of applying 60 per cent of its key performance indicators for staff to profit, and half of that to sales targets.\n\n\"Bankwest staff were able to double base salaries through such bonus payments and this created a culture of prioritising sales to [the] detriment of diligently and prudent conduct in relation to loan approvals,\" she said.\n\nThe findings against Rabobank centre on conflicts of interest through internal appraisals of property values and a sales-driven culture that Ms Orr noted was still in place.\n\nNAB faces findings of misconduct over its use of default interest payments as a \"strategic tool to put pressure\" on farmers suffering hardship from natural disasters such as drought and flood.\n\nQuestions for the banks\n\nAmong the questions Ms Orr asked the banks to answer in written submissions were:\n\n What does it mean for a bank to act fairly and reasonably to customers in a consistent and ethical manner? (ANZ)\n Does remuneration that rewards bank employees for sales create an unacceptable risk to banks' responsible lending obligations and statutory obligations for efficiency, fairness and honesty and ensure the customer is not disadvantaged? (CBA)\n To what extent does default interest reflect the cost of impaired loans and should a moratorium be placed of such payments during natural disasters? (NAB)\n Is it appropriate to write internal appraisals as opposed to seeking independent valuation and should the banks have a code of conduct covering valuations? (Rabobank)\n\nMr Hayne cautioned banks not to argue \"things have changed\".\n\n\"It occurs to me some may say 'times have changed', standards have somehow changed,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, if someone is going to say that, I will be assisted in knowing how and why.\n\n\"If we are dealing in concepts like fairness it is not instantly apparent to me what is fair today is not different to what was fair yesterday.\"\n\nMr Hayne said the banks also needed to think carefully when answering questions about balancing the interests of the banks and their customers.\n\n\"It could be minimising loss to the bank and the loss to the customer may be parallel, rather than competing,\" he said.",

    "fullBody": "Self-regulator Finra's proposed overhaul of how it regulates brokers with a history of misconduct doesn't go far enough, the financial reform group Better Markets says, according to InvestmentNews. But the industry body is planning to take more control and oversight of the hiring of high-risk brokers. Thursday Finra announced it will take over the task of reviewing public records of brokers newly registered with a company. The task was previously the responsibility of the firms, the regulator says in a press release.\n\nIn April, the industry body issued a request for comment on measures to bolster controls on rogue brokers, such as a provision to let Finra's hearing panels set conditions or restrictions on brokers and firms in the process of appealing disciplinary issues.\n\nThe comment period ended June 29, with Finra receiving nine letters, according to InvestmentNews.\n\nIn its comment letter sent on the last day of the comment period, Better Markets charges that Finra's proposal, while it \u00e2\u0080\u009cgestures in the right direction,\u00e2\u0080\u009d will not adequately address the issue, the publication writes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFinra must go far beyond this proposal to credibly claim that it is serious in its intention not just to hold brokers accountable, but also to protect investors from brokers who have demonstrated a proclivity to violate the law,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Better Markets officials wrote in the letter cited by InvestmentNews.\n\nAnd Dennis Kelleher, the group's CEO, says Finra's April proposal doesn't even match the intent expressed in June 2017 by Finra president and chief executive Robert Cook, according to the publication. Cook said then that financial markets had \u00e2\u0080\u009czero room for bad actors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to InvestmentNews.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn stark contrast to 'zero room,' however, this release tinkers on the margins by, essentially, making it a little bit costlier for firms to hire bad brokers, and by making them jump through an additional hoop before they can hire brokers with checkered pasts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kelleher wrote, according to the publication.\n\nBut the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association said Finra's proposed reforms would indeed benefit investors, InvestmentNews writes. The industry group Sifma, meanwhile, said it supports the proposal but requested some procedural changes, according to the publication.\n\nMeanwhile, starting Monday, Finra will go over the public records of new hires when a company applies to register new employees with the regulator, the self-regulator says in a press release.\n\nFinra says it will complete each review within 15 calendar days after the application.\n\nCurrently, firms must validate the answers brokers provide on Form U4 when they're hired \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which has resulted in firms outsourcing the task, Finra says.\n\nThe self-regulator will now take over the review, but the firms will still be responsible for the investigation of any deficiencies on the form identified by Finra, according to the press release.\n\nThe regulator claims the change will improve the quality of data available on its Central Registration Depository \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the database of Finra-member firms and brokers, as well as on BrokerCheck, its investor-facing online tool.\n\nFinra claims the new activity will save firms $1.5 million to $3 million per year in aggregate on fees they would have otherwise paid to third-party firms to conduct the reviews, as well as on late-submission fees charged by Finra.\n\nBy Alex Padalka\n\n* To read the InvestmentNews article cited in this story, click here.",

    "fullBody": "With the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule now good and dead, the lobbyists who helped orchestrate its demise have turned to the SEC's proposed Regulation Best Interest, according to Investopedia.\n\nLast month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals officially vacated the DOL's rule, the Obama-era regulation that purported to require retirement account advisors to put clients' interests first.\n\nThe SEC, meanwhile, is in the middle of a public comment period on its own best interest standard for broker-dealers as well as clarification of fiduciary responsibilities for investment advisors, Investopedia writes.\n\nAnd the industry groups that were \u00e2\u0080\u009cinstrumental\u00e2\u0080\u009d in killing the DOL's rule \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors and co-plaintiffs including Sifma, the Financial Services Institute and the American Council of Life Insurers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are now going after the SEC's proposed regulations, according to the web publication.\n\nThe SEC's proposal for a client relationship summary, which has a provision to ban broker-dealers from using the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvisor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d is NAIFA's first concern, Investopedia writes. After all, most NAIFA members, who are primarily insurance agents and broker-dealer representatives, are not RIAs and are only held to the less stringent suitability standard rather than the fiduciary standard, according to the web publication.\n\nNAIFA argues that if its members can't call themselves \u00e2\u0080\u009cadvisors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they'll be barred from offering financial advice, Investopedia writes. That, the industry group claims, would make it harder for them to offer advice to less affluent clients, according to the web publication.\n\nNAIFA's lobbyists have already met with the SEC, including Chairman Jay Clayton, Investopedia writes.\n\nMeanwhile, the Financial Planning Association could be pulling the SEC in the opposite direction, according to the web publication. Its members are certified financial planners, Investopedia writes, and the CFP Board recently approved revisions to its code of conduct that expanded the fiduciary standard to all financial advice.\n\nFPA President Frank Par\u00c3\u00a9 recently told FA magazine that a \u00e2\u0080\u009csuitability-plus\u00e2\u0080\u009d standard, which some critics say will be what comes out of the SEC, could sow confusion among investors, according to Investopedia. Par\u00c3\u00a9 told FA magazine that talk of a lawsuit targeting the SEC is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpremature\u00e2\u0080\u009d but added that it's a \u00e2\u0080\u009clegitimate question,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Investopedia writes. There's now speculation that the FPA will indeed file a lawsuit against the SEC, according to the web publication.\n\nBy Alex Padalka\n\n* To read the Investopedia article cited in this story, click here.",
