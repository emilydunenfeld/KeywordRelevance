Some banks are not willing to wait.\n\nBarely three months into MiFID II, Volksbank Sprockhoevel decided it did not want to go through so many disclosures on calls with active investors.\n\nInstead, the lender with 25,000 clients sent customers a standardized, one-time letter laying out the costs of buying or selling securities.",

Bond sales from France and Spain added to upward pressure on yields across broader markets.\n\nAccording to a source-based story from Bloomberg news late on Wednesday, some ECB officials see the pricing-in of a end-2019 rate rise by markets as too far into the future.\n\nAnalysts said the story highlighted a degree of complacency in markets since the ECB last month announced that its massive stimulus would end in December, but that interest rates would stay low through the summer of 2019.\n\nReuters reported last week that the ECB is considering buying more long-dated bonds from next year to keep euro zone borrowing costs in check - pushing down longer-dated bond yields further.\n\n\u201cMaybe the ECB wanted to counter-balance some of the excitement we\u2019ve seen in the last week and keep the possibility of a rate hike firmly on the table,\u201d said Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING.\n\nInvestors fully price in a 10 basis point rise in the ECB\u2019s deposit rate in October 2019, according to forward Eonia money market rates. Before the ECB\u2019s June 14 meeting, a rate hike had been anticipated for July 2019.\n\nGermany\u2019s two-year bond yield rose to a two-week high at minus 0.64 percent, and was last up 2 basis points.\n\nLong-dated bond yields across the single-currency bloc were 1-3 bps higher on the day .\n\nECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Thursday that uncertainty about the inflation outlook has been declining significantly.\n\nBond yields also faced upward pressure after hawkish comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pushed up British gilt yields .\n\nFrance and Spain issued almost 13 billion euros worth of government debt, adding to the selling pressure in debt markets.\n\nStill, 30-year bonds continued their outperformance in a sign that the far-end of the yield curve continues to benefit from an expectation that the ECB will plough funds from maturing bonds it holds back into longer-dated debt next year.\n\nFocus turned to the release due later in the day of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting.\n\n\u201cOur U.S. economists believe that discussion regarding trade developments and the flattening yield curve will be of note given recent comments by Fed officials,\u201d Deutsche Bank said in a note.\n\nUnease in world stock markets ahead of a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports was seen limiting the sell-off in safe-haven government debt.\n\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Toby Chopra\n\nOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "fullBody": "Claire Jones, Frankfurt\n\nJanuary 17, 2018\nPrint this page\n\nAn EU watchdog wants the European Central Bank to ban Mario Draghi, its president, and other senior officials from an exclusive club of global financiers, saying the links could erode belief in the institution's independence.\n\nEmily O'Reilly, the European Ombudsman, said Mr Draghi's membership of the Group of Thirty club of leading central bankers and senior figures from the private sector, \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould undermine public confidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cconstitutes maladministration\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe recommendation that the ECB president suspend his membership highlights how the close links between central bankers and the private sector have aroused public suspicion since the global financial crisis triggered a series of bank bailouts, with the perception of a revolving door between financial officialdom and private lenders.\n\nThe G30 meets privately and includes representatives of financial sector asset managers and banks such as BlackRock, JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and UBS. None is supervised directly by the ECB.\n\nMark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, William Dudley, departing president of the New York Federal Reserve, and Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, are members of the G30 along with former officials including Jean-Claude Trichet and Ben Bernanke. Mr Draghi last attended a meeting in 2015.\n\nWhile there was no evidence of direct influence on ECB policy, the watchdog said Mr Draghi's membership \u00e2\u0080\u009ccould, by creating a perception that the independence of the ECB is compromised, unnecessarily damage the image of, and thus the vital public trust in, the ECB\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe ombudsman added that the bank should \u00e2\u0080\u009cseek to ensure\u00e2\u0080\u009d that none of its monetary policymakers or senior supervisors join the body once Mr Draghi's term at the ECB ends next year.\n\nThe watchdog investigated Mr Draghi's G30 membership in 2012. The case was reopened in 2016, after the ECB took on responsibility for eurozone banking supervision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe implied closeness of the relationship through membership \u00e2\u0080\u0094 particularly between a supervising bank and those it supervises \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is not compatible with the independence obligation of an institution such as the ECB, for which independence is a hallmark of its operations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the ombudsman said. It has asked the ECB for a response by April.\n\nThe ECB has come under fire for its links to the private sector on more than one occasion.

Bond sales from France and Spain added to upward pressure on yields across broader markets.\n\nAccording to a source-based story from Bloomberg news late on Wednesday, some ECB officials see the pricing-in of a end-2019 rate rise by markets as too far into the future.\n\nAnalysts said the story highlighted a degree of complacency in markets since the ECB last month announced that its massive stimulus would end in December, but that interest rates would stay low through the summer of 2019.\n\nReuters reported last week that the ECB is considering buying more long-dated bonds from next year to keep euro zone borrowing costs in check - pushing down longer-dated bond yields further.\n\n\u201cMaybe the ECB wanted to counter-balance some of the excitement we\u2019ve seen in the last week and keep the possibility of a rate hike firmly on the table,\u201d said Martin van Vliet, senior rates strategist at ING.\n\nInvestors fully price in a 10 basis point rise in the ECB\u2019s deposit rate in October 2019, according to forward Eonia money market rates. Before the ECB\u2019s June 14 meeting, a rate hike had been anticipated for July 2019.\n\nGermany\u2019s two-year bond yield rose to a two-week high at minus 0.64 percent, and was last up 2 basis points.\n\nLong-dated bond yields across the single-currency bloc were 1-3 bps higher on the day .\n\nECB chief economist Peter Praet said on Thursday that uncertainty about the inflation outlook has been declining significantly.\n\nBond yields also faced upward pressure after hawkish comments from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pushed up British gilt yields .\n\nFrance and Spain issued almost 13 billion euros worth of government debt, adding to the selling pressure in debt markets.\n\nStill, 30-year bonds continued their outperformance in a sign that the far-end of the yield curve continues to benefit from an expectation that the ECB will plough funds from maturing bonds it holds back into longer-dated debt next year.\n\nFocus turned to the release due later in the day of minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s last meeting.\n\n\u201cOur U.S. economists believe that discussion regarding trade developments and the flattening yield curve will be of note given recent comments by Fed officials,\u201d Deutsche Bank said in a note.\n\nUnease in world stock markets ahead of a U.S. deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports was seen limiting the sell-off in safe-haven government debt.\n\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Toby Chopra\n\nOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
